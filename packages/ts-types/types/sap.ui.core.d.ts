    /**
     * @SINCE 1.27.0
     *
     * Defines a JavaScript module with its ID, its dependencies and a module export value or factory.
     *
     * The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to `sap.ui.define`
     * in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the
     * corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}.
     * The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level `sap.ui.define` call.
     *
     * If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request
     * the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be
     * loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was
     * given as `vFactory`, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will
     * be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and
     * its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting
     * value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module
     * is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).
     *
     * Example:
     *  The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js',
     * it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {
     *
     *     // create a new class
     *     var SomeClass = function() {};
     *
     *     // add methods to its prototype
     *     SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {
     *
     *         // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )
     *         var mSettings = Helper.foo();
     *
     *         // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')
     *         return new Bar(mSettings);
     *
     *     }
     *
     *     // return the class as module value
     *     return SomeClass;
     *
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * In another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load
     * the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {
     *
     *   // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it
     *   new Something().foo();
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Module Name Syntax:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name}
     * syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax
     * is, that for `sap.ui.define` and `sap.ui.require`, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to
     * be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.
     *
     * As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by
     * the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).
     *
     * It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names
     * for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming
     * of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
     *
     * Dependency to Modules:
     *
     * If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently
     * defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined
     * module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to
     * a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies
     * array.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the dependency modules are executed is **not** defined by the order
     * in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies between the dependency
     * modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither
     * module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution
     * order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
     *
     * **Note:** A static module export (a literal provided to `sap.ui.define`) cannot depend on the module
     * exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As
     * an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function,
     * potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach
     * must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
     *
     * Asynchronous Contract:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although
     * it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However,
     * callers of `sap.ui.define` must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific
     * test scenario.
     *
     * For example, callers of `sap.ui.define` must not use the module export value immediately after invoking
     * `sap.ui.define`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
     *
     *   // define a class Something as AMD module
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
     *     var Something = function() {};
     *     return Something;
     *   });
     *
     *   // DON'T DO THAT!
     *   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
     *   new Something();
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Differences to Standard AMD:
     *
     * The current implementation of `sap.ui.define` differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)
     * or from concrete AMD loaders like `requireJS` in several aspects:
     * 	 - The name `sap.ui.define` is different from the plain `define`. This has two reasons: first, it avoids
     * 			the impression that `sap.ui.define` is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows
     * 			the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and `sap.ui.define` in one application as long as UI5
     * 			or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference
     * 			of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect
     * 			methods `define` and `require` to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax,
     * 			can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global
     * 			namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them
     * 			using the `amd:true` flag (see example above)
     * 	 - Depending on configuration and the current context, `sap.ui.define` loads the dependencies of a module
     * 			either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading
     * 			is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce
     * 			synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications
     * 			that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs like
     * 			{@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not
     * 			planned to support this in future
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module
     * 			names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered
     * 			that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does **not** support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations
     * 			using `sap.ui.require("something")` are automagically converted into `sap.ui.define` dependencies before
     * 			executing the factory function.
     *
     * Limitations, Design Considerations:
     * 	 - **Limitation**: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure
     * 			proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously,
     * 			this only works as long as `sap.ui.define` uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous
     * 			loading is implemented.
     * 	 - It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout
     * 			of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync `jQuery.sap.require`
     * 			call can load a `sap.ui.define`'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously,
     * 			the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)
     *
     * 	 - A single file must not contain multiple calls to `sap.ui.define`. Multiple calls currently are only
     * 			supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of
     * 			how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract
     * See:
     * 	https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api

     * Or you can pass the reference to a DOM element and use this DOM element as a source for the template:
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.template(oDomRef);
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The last option to use this function is to pass the information via a configuration object. This configuration
     * object can be used to pass a context for the templating framework when compiling the template:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   var oTemplateById = sap.ui.template({
     *     id: "theTemplateId",
     *     context: { ... }
     *   });
     *
     *   var oTemplateByDomRef = sap.ui.template({
     *     domref: oDomRef,
     *     context: { ... }
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * It can also be used to load a template from another file:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   var oTemplate = sap.ui.template({
     *     id: "myTemplate",
     *     src: "myTemplate.tmpl"
     *   });
     *
     *   var oTemplateWithContext = sap.ui.template({
     *     id: "myTemplate",
     *     src: "myTemplate.tmpl",
     *     context: { ... }
     *   });
     * ```

     * @SINCE 1.27.0
     *
     * Defines a JavaScript module with its ID, its dependencies and a module export value or factory.
     *
     * The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to `sap.ui.define`
     * in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the
     * corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}.
     * The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level `sap.ui.define` call.
     *
     * If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request
     * the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be
     * loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was
     * given as `vFactory`, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will
     * be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and
     * its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting
     * value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module
     * is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).
     *
     * Example:
     *  The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js',
     * it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {
     *
     *     // create a new class
     *     var SomeClass = function() {};
     *
     *     // add methods to its prototype
     *     SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {
     *
     *         // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )
     *         var mSettings = Helper.foo();
     *
     *         // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')
     *         return new Bar(mSettings);
     *
     *     }
     *
     *     // return the class as module value
     *     return SomeClass;
     *
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * In another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load
     * the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {
     *
     *   // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it
     *   new Something().foo();
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Module Name Syntax:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name}
     * syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax
     * is, that for `sap.ui.define` and `sap.ui.require`, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to
     * be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.
     *
     * As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by
     * the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).
     *
     * It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names
     * for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming
     * of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
     *
     * Dependency to Modules:
     *
     * If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently
     * defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined
     * module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to
     * a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies
     * array.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the dependency modules are executed is **not** defined by the order
     * in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies between the dependency
     * modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither
     * module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution
     * order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
     *
     * **Note:** A static module export (a literal provided to `sap.ui.define`) cannot depend on the module
     * exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As
     * an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function,
     * potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach
     * must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
     *
     * Asynchronous Contract:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although
     * it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However,
     * callers of `sap.ui.define` must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific
     * test scenario.
     *
     * For example, callers of `sap.ui.define` must not use the module export value immediately after invoking
     * `sap.ui.define`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
     *
     *   // define a class Something as AMD module
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
     *     var Something = function() {};
     *     return Something;
     *   });
     *
     *   // DON'T DO THAT!
     *   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
     *   new Something();
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Differences to Standard AMD:
     *
     * The current implementation of `sap.ui.define` differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)
     * or from concrete AMD loaders like `requireJS` in several aspects:
     * 	 - The name `sap.ui.define` is different from the plain `define`. This has two reasons: first, it avoids
     * 			the impression that `sap.ui.define` is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows
     * 			the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and `sap.ui.define` in one application as long as UI5
     * 			or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference
     * 			of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect
     * 			methods `define` and `require` to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax,
     * 			can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global
     * 			namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them
     * 			using the `amd:true` flag (see example above)
     * 	 - Depending on configuration and the current context, `sap.ui.define` loads the dependencies of a module
     * 			either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading
     * 			is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce
     * 			synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications
     * 			that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs like
     * 			{@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not
     * 			planned to support this in future
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module
     * 			names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered
     * 			that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does **not** support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations
     * 			using `sap.ui.require("something")` are automagically converted into `sap.ui.define` dependencies before
     * 			executing the factory function.
     *
     * Limitations, Design Considerations:
     * 	 - **Limitation**: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure
     * 			proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously,
     * 			this only works as long as `sap.ui.define` uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous
     * 			loading is implemented.
     * 	 - It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout
     * 			of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync `jQuery.sap.require`
     * 			call can load a `sap.ui.define`'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously,
     * 			the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)
     *
     * 	 - A single file must not contain multiple calls to `sap.ui.define`. Multiple calls currently are only
     * 			supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of
     * 			how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract
     * See:
     * 	https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api

     * @SINCE 1.27.0
     *
     * Defines a JavaScript module with its ID, its dependencies and a module export value or factory.
     *
     * The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to `sap.ui.define`
     * in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the
     * corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}.
     * The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level `sap.ui.define` call.
     *
     * If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request
     * the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be
     * loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was
     * given as `vFactory`, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will
     * be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and
     * its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting
     * value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module
     * is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).
     *
     * Example:
     *  The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js',
     * it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {
     *
     *     // create a new class
     *     var SomeClass = function() {};
     *
     *     // add methods to its prototype
     *     SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {
     *
     *         // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )
     *         var mSettings = Helper.foo();
     *
     *         // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')
     *         return new Bar(mSettings);
     *
     *     }
     *
     *     // return the class as module value
     *     return SomeClass;
     *
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * In another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load
     * the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {
     *
     *   // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it
     *   new Something().foo();
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Module Name Syntax:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name}
     * syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax
     * is, that for `sap.ui.define` and `sap.ui.require`, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to
     * be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.
     *
     * As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by
     * the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).
     *
     * It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names
     * for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming
     * of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
     *
     * Dependency to Modules:
     *
     * If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently
     * defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined
     * module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to
     * a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies
     * array.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the dependency modules are executed is **not** defined by the order
     * in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies between the dependency
     * modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither
     * module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution
     * order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
     *
     * **Note:** A static module export (a literal provided to `sap.ui.define`) cannot depend on the module
     * exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As
     * an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function,
     * potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach
     * must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
     *
     * Asynchronous Contract:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although
     * it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However,
     * callers of `sap.ui.define` must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific
     * test scenario.
     *
     * For example, callers of `sap.ui.define` must not use the module export value immediately after invoking
     * `sap.ui.define`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
     *
     *   // define a class Something as AMD module
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
     *     var Something = function() {};
     *     return Something;
     *   });
     *
     *   // DON'T DO THAT!
     *   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
     *   new Something();
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *

     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Differences to Standard AMD:
     *
     * The current implementation of `sap.ui.define` differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)
     * or from concrete AMD loaders like `requireJS` in several aspects:
     * 	 - The name `sap.ui.define` is different from the plain `define`. This has two reasons: first, it avoids
     * 			the impression that `sap.ui.define` is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows
     * 			the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and `sap.ui.define` in one application as long as UI5
     * 			or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference
     * 			of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect
     * 			methods `define` and `require` to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax,
     * 			can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global
     * 			namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them
     * 			using the `amd:true` flag (see example above)
     * 	 - Depending on configuration and the current context, `sap.ui.define` loads the dependencies of a module
     * 			either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading
     * 			is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce
     * 			synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications
     * 			that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs like
     * 			{@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not
     * 			planned to support this in future
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module
     * 			names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered
     * 			that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does **not** support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations
     * 			using `sap.ui.require("something")` are automagically converted into `sap.ui.define` dependencies before
     * 			executing the factory function.
     *
     * Limitations, Design Considerations:
     * 	 - **Limitation**: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure
     * 			proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously,
     * 			this only works as long as `sap.ui.define` uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous
     * 			loading is implemented.
     * 	 - It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout
     * 			of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync `jQuery.sap.require`
     * 			call can load a `sap.ui.define`'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously,
     * 			the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)
     *
     * 	 - A single file must not contain multiple calls to `sap.ui.define`. Multiple calls currently are only
     * 			supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of
     * 			how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract
     * See:
     * 	https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api

         * 			and convert them to the corresponding value; `isValid` will accept any of the values from the plain object's
         * 			keys. The `defaultValue` will be the value of the first key found in the plain object

       * Base Class that introduces some basic concepts like state management or databinding.
       *
       * New subclasses of ManagedObject are created with a call to {@link #.extend ManagedObject.extend} and
       * can make use of the following managed features:
       *
       * Properties: Managed properties represent the state of a ManagedObject. They can store a single value
       * of a simple data type (like 'string' or 'int'). They have a name (e.g. 'size') and methods to
       * get the current value (`getSize`), or to set a new value (`setSize`). When a property is modified, the
       * ManagedObject is marked as invalidated. A managed property can be bound against a property in a {@link
       * sap.ui.model.Model} by using the {@link #bindProperty} method. Updates to the model property will be
       * automatically reflected in the managed property and - if TwoWay databinding is active, changes to the
       * managed property will be reflected in the model. An existing binding can be removed by calling {@link
       * #unbindProperty}.
       *
       * If a ManagedObject is cloned, the clone will have the same values for its managed properties as the source
       * of the clone - if the property wasn't bound. If it is bound, the property in the clone will be bound
       * to the same model property as in the source.
       *
       * Details about the declaration of a managed property, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods
       * that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend
       * extend } method.
       *
       * Aggregations: Managed aggregations can store one or more references to other ManagedObjects. They are
       * a mean to control the lifecycle of the aggregated objects: one ManagedObject can be aggregated by at
       * most one parent ManagedObject at any time. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, all aggregated objects
       * are destroyed as well and the object itself is removed from its parent. That is, aggregations won't contain
       * destroyed objects or null/undefined.
       *
       * Aggregations have a name ('e.g 'header' or 'items'), a cardinality ('0..1' or '0..n') and
       * are of a specific type (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface).
       * A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the aggregated object for a specific aggregation of
       * cardinality 0..1 (e.g. `setHeader`, `getHeader` for an aggregation named 'header'). For an aggregation
       * of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all aggregated objects (`getItems`), to locate an object
       * in the aggregation (e.g. `indexOfItem`), to add, insert or remove a single aggregated object (`addItem`,
       * `insertItem`, `removeItem`) or to remove or destroy all objects from an aggregation (`removeAllItems`,
       * `destroyItems`).
       *
       * Details about the declaration of a managed aggregation, the metadata that describes the aggregation,
       * and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation
       * of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
       *
       * Aggregations of cardinality 0..n can be bound to a collection in a model by using {@link #bindAggregation}
       * (and unbound again using {@link #unbindAggregation}). For each context in the model collection, a corresponding
       * object will be created in the managed aggregation, either by cloning a template object or by calling
       * a factory function.
       *
       * Aggregations also control the databinding context of bound objects: by default, aggregated objects inherit
       * all models and binding contexts from their parent object.
       *
       * When a ManagedObject is cloned, all aggregated objects will be cloned as well - but only if they haven't
       * been added by databinding. In that case, the aggregation in the clone will be bound to the same model
       * collection.
       *
       * Associations: Managed associations also form a relationship between objects, but they don't define a
       * lifecycle for the associated objects. They even can 'break' in the sense that an associated object might
       * have been destroyed already although it is still referenced in an association. For the same reason, the
       * internal storage for associations are not direct object references but only the IDs of the associated
       * target objects.
       *
       * Associations have a name ('e.g 'initialFocus'), a cardinality ('0..1' or '0..n') and are
       * of a specific type (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject
       * will provide methods to set or get the associated object for a specific association of cardinality 0..1
       * (e.g. `setInitialFocus`, `getInitialFocus`). For an association of cardinality 0..n, there are methods
       * to get all associated objects (`getRefItems`), to add, insert or remove a single associated object (`addRefItem`,
       * `insertRefItem`, `removeRefItem`) or to remove all objects from an association (`removeAllRefItems`).
       *
       * Details about the declaration of a managed association, the metadata that describes it and the set of
       * methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link
       * sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
       *
       * Associations can't be bound to the model.
       *
       * When a ManagedObject is cloned, the result for an association depends on the relationship between the
       * associated target object and the root of the clone operation. If the associated object is part of the
       * to-be-cloned object tree (reachable via aggregations from the root of the clone operation), then the
       * cloned association will reference the clone of the associated object. Otherwise the association will
       * reference the same object as in the original tree. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, other objects that
       * are only associated, are not affected by the destroy operation.
       *
       * Events: Managed events provide a mean for communicating important state changes to an arbitrary number
       * of 'interested' listeners. Events have a name and (optionally) a set of parameters. For
       * each event there will be methods to add or remove an event listener as well as a method to fire the event.
       * (e.g. `attachChange`, `detachChange`, `fireChange` for an event named 'change').
       *
       * Details about the declaration of managed events, the metadata that describes the event, and the set of
       * methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link
       * sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
       *
       * When a ManagedObject is cloned, all listeners registered for any event in the clone source are also registered
       * to the clone. Later changes are not reflected in any direction (neither from source to clone, nor vice
       * versa).
       *
       * Low Level APIs:: The prototype of ManagedObject provides several generic, low
       * level APIs to manage properties, aggregations, associations, and events. These generic methods are solely
       * intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single managed property etc.
       * (e.g. a function `setSize(value)` that sets a new value for property 'size'). {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend}
       * creates default implementations of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation
       * of a subclass then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation, e.g.
       * to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is therefore important to
       * understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed
       * object, as that would bypass the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.
       */
      class ManagedObject extends sap.ui.base.EventProvider {
        /**
         * Constructs and initializes a managed object with the given `sId` and settings.
         *
         * If the optional `mSettings` are given, they must be a simple object that defines values for properties,
         * aggregations, associations or events keyed by their name.
         *
         * **Valid Names and Value Ranges:**
         *
         * The property (key) names supported in the object literal are exactly the (case sensitive) names documented
         * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the current class and its base
         * classes. Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this name usually is the plural name, whereas
         * it is the singular name in case of 0..1 relations.
         *
         * If a key name is ambiguous for a specific managed object class (e.g. a property has the same name as
         * an event), then this method prefers property, aggregation, association and event in that order. To resolve
         * such ambiguities, the keys can be prefixed with `aggregation:`, `association:` or `event:` (such keys
         * containing a colon (':') must be quoted to be valid Javascript).
         *
         * The possible values for a setting depend on its kind:
         * 	 - for simple properties, the value has to match the documented type of the property (no type conversion
         * 			occurs)
         * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated type
         * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type or a single
         * 			instance
         * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
         * 	 - for 0..n associations, an array of instances of the associated type or of IDs is accepted
         * 	 - for events either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
         * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on.
         *
         * Each subclass should document the name and type of its supported settings in its constructor documentation.
         *
         * Example usage:
         * ```javascript
         *
         * new Dialog({
         *    title: "Some title text",            // property of type "string"
         *    showHeader: true,                    // property of type "boolean"
         *    endButton: new Button(...),          // 0..1 aggregation
         *    content: [                           // 0..n aggregation
         *       new Input(...),
         *       new Input(...)
         *    ],
         *    afterClose: function(oEvent) { ... } // event handler function
         * });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * Instead of static values and object instances, data binding expressions can be used, either embedded
         * in a string or as a binding info object as described in {@link #bindProperty} or {@link #bindAggregation}.
         *
         * Example usage:
         * ```javascript
         *
         * new Dialog({
         *    title: "{/title}",       // embedded binding expression, points to a string property in the data model
         *    ...
         *    content: {               // binding info object
         *       path : "/inputItems", // points to a collection in the data model
         *       template : new Input(...)
         *    }
         * });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * Note that when setting string values, any curly braces in those values need to be escaped, so they are
         * not interpreted as binding expressions. Use {@link #escapeSettingsValue} to do so.
         *
         * Besides the settings documented below, ManagedObject itself supports the following special settings:
         *
         * 	 - `id : sap.ui.core.ID` an ID for the new instance. Some subclasses (Element, Component) require
         * 			the id to be unique in a specific scope (e.g. an Element Id must be unique across all Elements, a Component
         * 			id must be unique across all Components). `models : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Model}
         * 			instances keyed by their model name (alias). Each entry with key k in this object has the same
         * 			effect as a call `this.setModel(models[k], k);`.
         * 	 - `bindingContexts : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Context} instances keyed by their
         * 			model name. Each entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.setBindingContext(bindingContexts[k],
         * 			k);`
         * 	 - `objectBindings : object` a map of binding paths keyed by the corresponding model name. Each
         * 			entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.bindObject(objectBindings[k],
         * 			k);` `metadataContexts : object` an array of single binding contexts keyed by the corresponding
         * 			model or context name. The purpose of the `metadataContexts` special setting is to deduce as much information
         * 			as possible from the binding context of the control in order to be able to predefine certain standard
         * 			properties like e.g. visible, enabled, tooltip,...
         *
         * The structure is an array of single contexts, where a single context is a map containing the following
         * keys:
         * 	 - `path: string (mandatory)` The path to the corresponding model property or object, e.g. '/Customers/Name'.
         * 			A path can also be relative, e.g. 'Name'
         * 	 - `model: string (optional)` The name of the model, in case there is no name then the undefined
         * 			model is taken
         * 	 - `name: string (optional)` A name for the context to used in templating phase
         * 	 - `kind: string (optional)` The kind of the adapter, either `field` for single properties or
         * 			`object` for structured contexts. `adapter: string (optional)` The path to an interpretion
         * 			class that dilivers control relevant data depending on the context, e.g. enabled, visible. If not supplied
         * 			the OData meta data is interpreted.  The syntax for providing the `metadataContexts` is as follows:
         * 			`{SINGLE_CONTEXT1},...,{SINGLE_CONTEXTn}` or for simplicity in case there is only one context `{SINGLE_CONTEXT}`.
         *
         * Examples for such metadataContexts are:
         * 	 - `{/Customers/Name}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name of the Customers
         * 			entity set in the default model
         * 	 - `{path: 'Customers/Name', model:'json'}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name
         * 			of the Customers entity set in a named model
         * 	 - `{parts: [{path: 'Customers/Name'},{path: 'editable', model: 'viewModel'}]}` a combination of single
         * 			binding contexts, one context from the default model and one from the viewModel

         * composite type} then can be used to combine the parts, Properties with a composite binding are also known
         * as "calculated fields".
         *
         * Example:
         * ```javascript
         *
         *   oTxt.bindValue({
         *     parts: [
         *       {path: "/firstName", type: "sap.ui.model.type.String"},
         *       {path: "myModel2>/lastName"}
         *     ]
         *   });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * Note that a composite binding will be forced into mode `OneWay` when one of the binding parts is not
         * in mode `TwoWay`.
         *
         * **Formatter Functions**
         *  When a formatter function is specified for the binding or for a binding part, it will be called with
         * the value of the bound model property. After setting the initial property value, the formatter function
         * will only be called again when the bound model property changes (simple property binding) or when at
         * least one of the bound model properties changes (formatter function of a composite binding). Note that
         * a binding only monitors the bound model data for changes. Dependencies of the formatter implementation
         * to other model data is not known to the binding and changes won't be detected.
         *
         * When the formatter for a property binding (simple or composite) is called, the managed object will be
         * given as `this` context. For formatters of binding parts in a composite binding, this is not the case.

         * The `oOptions` configuration object can have the following properties:
         * 	 - The boolean value `cloneChildren` specifies whether associations/aggregations will be cloned
         * 	 - The boolean value `cloneBindings` specifies if bindings will be cloned
         *
         * For each cloned object the following settings are cloned based on the metadata of the object and the
         * defined options:
         * 	 - all properties that are not bound. If `cloneBinding` is `false`, even these properties will be cloned;
         * 			the values are used by reference, they are not cloned
         * 	 - all aggregated objects that are not bound. If `cloneBinding` is `false`, even the ones that are bound
         * 			will be cloned; they are all cloned recursively using the same `sIdSuffix`
         * 	 - all associated controls; when an association points to an object inside the cloned object tree, then
         * 			the cloned association will be modified to that it points to the clone of the target object. When the
         * 			association points to a managed object outside of the cloned object tree, then its target won't be changed.
         *
         * 	 - all models set via `setModel()`; used by reference
         * 	 - all property and aggregation bindings (if `cloneBindings` is `true`); the pure binding information
         * 			(path, model name) is cloned, but all other information like template control or factory function, data
         * 			type or formatter function are copied by reference. The bindings themselves are created anew as they
         * 			are specific for the combination (object, property, model). As a result, any later changes to a binding
         * 			of the original object are not reflected in the clone, but changes to e.g the type or template etc. are.
         *
         *
         * Each clone is created by first collecting the above mentioned settings and then creating a new instance
         * with the normal constructor function. As a result, any side effects of mutator methods (`setProperty`
         * etc.) or init hooks are repeated during clone creation. There is no need to override `clone()` just to
         * reproduce these internal settings!
         *
         * Custom controls however can override `clone()` to implement additional clone steps. They usually will

         * Detailed explanation of properties
         *
         *
         * **'library'** : string
         *  Name of the library that the new subclass should belong to. If the subclass is a control or element,
         * it will automatically register with that library so that authoring tools can discover it. By convention,
         * the name of the subclass should have the library name as a prefix, e.g. 'sap.ui.commons.Panel' belongs
         * to library 'sap.ui.commons'.
         *
         * **'properties'** : object
         *  An object literal whose properties each define a new managed property in the ManagedObject subclass.
         * The value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new property
         * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
         * 	 - `type: string` type of the new property. Must either be one of the built-in types 'string',
         * 			'boolean', 'int', 'float', 'object' or 'any', or a type created and registered with {@link sap.ui.base.DataType.createType}
         * 			or an array type based on one of the previous types.
         * 	 - `group:string` a semantic grouping of the properties, intended to be used in design time tools.
         * 			Allowed values are (case sensitive): Accessibility, Appearance, Behavior, Data, Designtime, Dimension,
         * 			Identification, Misc
         * 	 - `defaultValue: any` the default value for the property or null if there is no defaultValue.
         *
         * 	 - `bindable: boolean|string` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true` or the
         * 			magic string 'bindable') If set to `true` or 'bindable', additional named methods `bindName` and
         * 			`unbindName` are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory
         * 			to make the managed property bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindProperty} and {@link #unbindProperty}
         * 			can always be used.  `selector: string` Optional; can be set to a valid CSS selector (as accepted
         * 			by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector}
         * 			method). When set, it locates the DOM element that represents this property's value. It should only be
         * 			set for properties that have a visual text representation in the DOM.
         *
         * The purpose of the selector is to allow other framework parts or design time tooling to identify the
         * DOM parts of a control or element that represent a specific property without knowing the control or element
         * implementation in detail.
         *
         * As an extension to the standard CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the placeholder
         * `{id}` (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all
         * occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or
         * control. In fact, any selector should start with `#{id}` to ensure that the query result is limited to
         * the desired element or control.
         *
         * **Note**: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates
         * the selector in the context of a concrete element or control instance. It also handles the placeholder
         * `{id}`. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and
         * might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the `selector`
         * in the metadata, element and control classes can overwrite `getDomRefForSetting` and determine the DOM
         * element dynamically.  Property names should use camelCase notation, start with a lowercase
         * letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded
         * by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet
         * will be used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
         *
         * For each public property 'foo', the following methods will be created by the "extend" method and will
         * be added to the prototype of the subclass:
         * 	 - getFoo() - returns the current value of property 'foo'. Internally calls {@link #getProperty}
         * 	 - setFoo(v) - sets 'v' as the new value of property 'foo'. Internally calls {@link #setProperty}
         * 	 - bindFoo(c) - (only if property was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps {@link
         * 			#bindProperty}
         * 	 - unbindFoo() - (only if property was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps {@link
         * 			#unbindProperty}
         *
         * **'defaultProperty'** : string
         *  When specified, the default property must match the name of one of the properties defined for the new
         * subclass (either own or inherited). The named property can be used to identify the main property to be
         * used for bound data. E.g. the value property of a field control.
         *
         * **'aggregations'** : object
         *  An object literal whose properties each define a new aggregation in the ManagedObject subclass. The
         * value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new aggregation
         * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
         * 	 - `type: string` type of the new aggregation. must be the full global name of a ManagedObject
         * 			subclass (in dot notation, e.g. 'sap.m.Button')
         * 	 - `[multiple]: boolean` whether the aggregation is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n aggregation (true),
         * 			defaults to true
         * 	 - `[singularName]: string`. Singular name for 0..n aggregations. For 0..n aggregations the name
         * 			by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an aggregation will use
         * 			the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular
         * 			name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns
         * 			and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can
         * 			be specified with this property.
         * 	 - `[visibility]: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Aggregations that
         * 			belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' aggregations typically are used for the
         * 			implementation of composite classes (e.g. composite controls)
         * 	 - `bindable: boolean|string` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true` or the
         * 			magic string 'bindable') If set to `true` or 'bindable', additional named methods `bindName` and
         * 			`unbindName` are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory
         * 			to make the managed aggregation bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindAggregation} and {@link #unbindAggregation}
         * 			can always be used.
         * 	 - `forwarding: object` If set, this defines a forwarding of objects added to this aggregation
         * 			into an aggregation of another ManagedObject - typically to an inner control within a composite control.
         * 			This means that all adding, removal, or other operations happening on the source aggregation are actually
         * 			called on the target instance. All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target
         * 			aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return
         * 			the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation. If present, the named (non-generic)
         * 			aggregation methods will be called for the target aggregation. Aggregations can only be forwarded to
         * 			non-hidden aggregations of the same or higher multiplicity (i.e. an aggregation with multiplicity "0..n"
         * 			cannot be forwarded to an aggregation with multiplicity "0..1"). The target aggregation must also be
         * 			"compatible" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must
         * 			also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error).
         * 			If the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source
         * 			element to make sure all models are available there as well. The aggregation target must remain the same
         * 			instance across the entire lifetime of the source control. Aggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly
         * 			when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or
         * 			by another forwarding from a different source aggregation). Hence, this is not allowed. The forwarding
         * 			configuration object defines the target of the forwarding. The available settings are:
         * 	`idSuffix: string`A string which is appended to the ID of this ManagedObject to construct
         * the ID of the target ManagedObject. This is one of the two options to specify the target. This option
         * requires the target instance to be created in the init() method of this ManagedObject and to be always
         * available.
         * 	 - `getter: string`The name of the function on instances of this ManagedObject which returns
         * 			the target instance. This second option to specify the target can be used for lazy instantiation of the
         * 			target. Note that either idSuffix or getter must be given. Also note that the target instance returned
         * 			by the getter must remain the same over the entire lifetime of this ManagedObject and the implementation
         * 			assumes that all instances return the same type of object (at least the target aggregation must always
         * 			be defined in the same class).
         * 	 - `aggregation: string`The name of the aggregation on the target into which the objects shall
         * 			be forwarded. The multiplicity of the target aggregation must be the same as the one of the source aggregation
         * 			for which forwarding is defined.
         * 	 - `[forwardBinding]: boolean`Whether any binding should happen on the forwarding target or not.
         * 			Default if omitted is `false`, which means any bindings happen on the outer ManagedObject. When the binding
         * 			is forwarded, all binding methods like updateAggregation, getBindingInfo, refreshAggregation etc. are
         * 			called on the target element of the forwarding instead of being called on this element. The basic aggregation
         * 			mutator methods (add/remove etc.) are only called on the forwarding target element. Without forwardBinding,
         * 			they are called on this element, but forwarded to the forwarding target, where they actually modify the
         * 			aggregation.    `selector: string` Optional; can be set to a valid CSS selector
         * 			(as accepted by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector}
         * 			method). When set, it locates the DOM element that surrounds the aggregation's content. It should only
         * 			be set for aggregations that have a visual representation in the DOM. A DOM element surrounding the aggregation's
         * 			rendered content should be available in the DOM, even if the aggregation is empty or not rendered for
         * 			some reason. In cases where this is not possible or not intended, `getDomRefForSetting` can be overridden,
         * 			see below.
         *
         * The purpose of the selector is to allow other framework parts like drag and drop or design time tooling
         * to identify those DOM parts of a control or element that represent a specific aggregation without knowing
         * the control or element implementation in detail.
         *
         * As an extension to the standard CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the placeholder
         * `{id}` (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all
         * occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or
         * control. In fact, any selector should start with `#{id}` to ensure that the query result is limited to
         * the desired element or control.
         *
         * **Note**: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates
         * the selector in the context of a concrete element or control instance. It also handles the placeholder
         * `{id}`. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and
         * might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the `selector`
         * in the metadata, element and control classes can overwrite `getDomRefForSetting` to calculate or add
         * the appropriate DOM Element dynamically.   Aggregation names should use camelCase notation,
         * start with a lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. The name for a hidden
         * aggregations might start with an underscore. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc
         * comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be
         * used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
         *
         * For each public aggregation 'item' of cardinality 0..1, the following methods will be created by the
         * "extend" method and will be added to the prototype of the subclass:
         * 	 - getItem() - returns the current value of aggregation 'item'. Internally calls {@link #getAggregation}
         * 			with a default value of `undefined`
         * 	 - setItem(o) - sets 'o' as the new aggregated object in aggregation 'item'. Internally calls {@link
         * 			#setAggregation}
         * 	 - destroyItem(o) - destroy a currently aggregated object in aggregation 'item' and clears the aggregation.
         * 			Internally calls {@link #destroyAggregation}
         * 	 - bindItem(c) - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
         * 			{@link #bindAggregation}
         * 	 - unbindItem() - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
         * 			{@link #unbindAggregation}  For a public aggregation 'items' of cardinality 0..n, the following
         * 			methods will be created:
         * 	 - getItems() - returns an array with the objects contained in aggregation 'items'. Internally calls
         * 			{@link #getAggregation} with a default value of `[]`
         * 	 - addItem(o) - adds an object as last element in the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #addAggregation}
         *
         * 	 - insertItem(o,p) - inserts an object into the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #insertAggregation}
         *
         * 	 - indexOfItem(o) - returns the position of the given object within the aggregation 'items'. Internally
         * 			calls {@link #indexOfAggregation}
         * 	 - removeItem(v) - removes an object from the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAggregation}
         *
         * 	 - removeItems() - removes all objects from the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAllAggregation}
         *
         * 	 - destroyItems() - destroy all currently aggregated objects in aggregation 'items' and clears the aggregation.
         * 			Internally calls {@link #destroyAggregation}
         * 	 - bindItems(c) - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
         * 			{@link #bindAggregation}
         * 	 - unbindItems() - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
         * 			{@link #unbindAggregation}  For private or hidden aggregations, no methods are generated.
         *
         * **'defaultAggregation'** : string
         *  When specified, the default aggregation must match the name of one of the aggregations defined for the
         * new subclass (either own or inherited). The named aggregation will be used in contexts where no aggregation
         * is specified. E,g. when an object in an XMLView embeds other objects without naming an aggregation, as
         * in the following example:
         * ```javascript
         *
         *  <!-- assuming the defaultAggregation for Dialog is 'content' -->
         *  <Dialog>
         *    <Text/>
         *    <Button/>
         *  </Dialog>
         * ```
         *
         *
         * **'associations'** : object
         *  An object literal whose properties each define a new association of the ManagedObject subclass. The
         * value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new association
         * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
         * 	 - `type: string` type of the new association
         * 	 - `multiple: boolean` whether the association is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n association (true),
         * 			defaults to false(1) for associations
         * 	 - `[singularName]: string`. Singular name for 0..n associations. For 0..n associations the name
         * 			by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an association will use
         * 			the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular
         * 			name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns
         * 			and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can
         * 			be specified with this property.  Association names should use camelCase notation, start with a
         * 			lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an association in the literal
         * 			is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation,
         * 			the doclet will be used as generic documentation of the association.
         *
         * For each association 'ref' of cardinality 0..1, the following methods will be created by the "extend"
         * method and will be added to the prototype of the subclass:
         * 	 - getRef() - returns the current value of association 'item'. Internally calls {@link #getAssociation}
         * 			with a default value of `undefined`
         * 	 - setRef(o) - sets 'o' as the new associated object in association 'item'. Internally calls {@link
         * 			#setAssociation}  For a public association 'refs' of cardinality 0..n, the following methods will
         * 			be created:
         * 	 - getRefs() - returns an array with the objects contained in association 'items'. Internally calls
         * 			{@link #getAssociation} with a default value of `[]`
         * 	 - addRef(o) - adds an object as last element in the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #addAssociation}
         *
         * 	 - removeRef(v) - removes an object from the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAssociation}
         *
         * 	 - removeAllRefs() - removes all objects from the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAllAssociation}
         *
         *
         * **'events'** : object
         *  An object literal whose properties each define a new event of the ManagedObject subclass. The value
         * can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new association or it
         * can be an object literal with the following properties
         * 	 - `allowPreventDefault: boolean` whether the event allows to prevented the default behavior
         * 			of the event source
         * 	 - `parameters: object` an object literal that describes the parameters of this event.
         * 			Event names should use camelCase notation, start with a lower-case letter and only use characters from
         * 			the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an event in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the
         * 			UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be used as generic documentation
         * 			of the event.
         *
         * For each event 'Some' the following methods will be created by the "extend" method and will be added
         * to the prototype of the subclass:
         * 	 - attachSome(fn,o) - registers a listener for the event. Internally calls {@link #attachEvent}
         * 	 - detachSome(fn,o) - deregisters a listener for the event. Internally calls {@link #detachEvent}
         * 	 - fireSome() - fire the event. Internally calls {@link #fireEvent}
         *
         * **'specialSettings'** : object
         *  Special settings are an experimental feature and MUST NOT BE DEFINED in controls or applications outside
         * of the `sap.ui.core` library. There's no generic or general way how to set or get the values for special
         * settings. For the same reason, they cannot be bound against a model. If there's a way for consumers to
         * define a value for a special setting, it must be documented in the class that introduces the setting.

         *
         * **Example:**
         *
         * Assume that a `Dialog` internally uses a (hidden) `VerticalLayout` to store its content:
         *
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         *   Dialog (API parent)
         *    \__ VerticalLayout (hidden composite part)
         *       \__ Text (API child)
         * ```
         *
         *
         * If you add some content by calling the `Dialog.prototype.addContent` API, this will lead to the following
         * observations:
         *
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         *   oDialog.addContent(oText);
         *   console.log(oText.getParent() === oDialog);  // false
         *   console.log(oText.getParent() instanceof VerticalLayout); // true
         *   console.log(oText.getParent().getParent() === oDialog); // true now, but might fail with later versions
         * ```
         *
         *
         * Technically, from API perspective, `oText` is added as a child to `Dialog`. But internally, the `Dialog`
         * adds the child to the hidden `VerticalLayout` container. If you now call the `getParent` method of the
         * child, you will get the internal `VerticalLayout` object and not the `Dialog` API parent.
         *
         * **Note: ** The internal (hidden) structure of a composite control is not fixed and may be changed (see
         * also our "Compatibility Rules"). Therefore, you should **never** rely on a specific structure or object
         * being returned by `getParent`.

         * 			of sap.ui.base.Object can enrich the set of supported metadata (e.g. see {@link sap.ui.core.Element.extend}).
         *
         *

         * 	 - `constructor:` a function that serves as a constructor function for the new class. If no constructor
         * 			function is given, the framework creates a default implementation that delegates all its arguments to
         * 			the constructor function of the base class.

       * 	 - `hasStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#hasStyleClass}  In addition the clone function of
       * 			the element is extended to ensure that the custom style classes are also available on the cloned element.

         * The `ItemNavigation` adjusts the `tabindex` of all DOM references relating to the current focused item.
         * So if the control containing the items gets the focus (e.g. via tab navigation), it is always the focused
         * items which will be focused.
         *
         * **Note:** If the `ItemNavigation` is nested in another `ItemNavigation` (e.g. `SegmentedButton` in `Toolbar`),
         * the `RootDomRef` will always have `tabindex` -1.
         *
         * Per default the `ItemNavigation` cycles over the items. It navigates again to the first item if the Arrow
         * Down or Arrow Right key is pressed while the last item has the focus. It navigates to the last item if
         * arrow up or arrow left is pressed while the first item has the focus. If you want to stop the navigation
         * at the first and last item, call the `setCycling` method with a value of `false`.
         *
         * It is possible to have multiple columns in the item navigation. If multiple columns are used, the keyboard
         * navigation changes. The Arrow Right and Arrow Left keys will take the user to the next or previous item,
         * and the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys will navigate the same way but in a vertical direction.
         *
         * The `ItemNavigation` also allows setting a selected index that is used to identify the selected item.
         * Initially, if no other focus is set, the selected item will be the focused one. Note that navigating
         * through the items will not change the selected item, only the focus. (For example a radio group has one
         * selected item.)

         *
         * **New Signature**

         *
         *

         *     function(Renderer) {
         *     "use strict";

         *     var LabelRenderer = Renderer.extend('sap.m.LabelRenderer', {
         *         render: function(oRM, oControl) {
         *
         *             renderPreamble(oRM, oControl);
         *
         *             // implementation core renderer logic here

         *
         *     return LabelRenderer;
         * });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * The extension of Renderers works across multiple levels. A FancyLabelRenderer can extend the above LabelRenderer:
         *
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         * sap.ui.define(['sap/m/LabelRenderer'],
         *     function(LabelRenderer) {
         *     "use strict";
         *
         *     var FancyLabelRenderer = LabelRenderer.extend('sap.mylib.FancyLabelRenderer', {
         *         render: function(oRM, oControl) {
         *
         *             // call base renderer
         *             LabelRenderer.renderPreamble(oRM, oControl);
         *
         *             // ... do your own fancy rendering here
         *
         *             // call base renderer again
         *             LabelRenderer.renderPostamble(oRM, oControl);
         *         }

         *
         *     return FancyLabelRenderer;
         * });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * **Note:** the new signature no longer requires the `bExport` flag to be set for the enclosing {@link
         * sap.ui.define} call. The Renderer base class takes care of the necessary global export of the renderer.
         * This allows Non-SAP developers to write a renderer that complies with the documented restriction for
         * `sap.ui.define` (no use of bExport = true outside sap.ui.core projects).
         *
         * **Deprecated Signature**
         *  The deprecated old signature expects just one parameter: a renderer that should be extended. With that
         * signature the renderer can't be exported globally as the name of the renderer class is not known.
         *
         * For compatibility reasons, the class created by the deprecated signature contains a property `_super`
         * that references the parent class. It shouldn't be used by applications / control developers as it doesn't
         * work reliably for deeper inheritance chains: if the old variant of `Renderer.extend` is used on two or
         * more levels of the inheritance hierarchy, the `_super` property of the resulting renderer class will
         * always point to the implementation of the base renderer of the last call to extend. Instead of using
         * `this._super`, renderer implementations should use the new signature variant and access the base implementation
         * of a method via the AMD reference to the base renderer (as shown in the FancyLabelRenderer example above).

         * This class provides methods for evaluating the possibility of using browser-native hyphenation or initializing
         * and using a third-party hyphenation module.
         *
         * Overview: By using this API, a developer can check if browser-native hyphenation is supported for a particular
         * language.
         *
         * When browser-native hyphenation is not supported or if otherwise required, the API can be used to hyphenate
         * texts. A third-party library "Hyphenopoly" is used in that case.
         *
         * It is used internally by controls that support the `wrappingType:{@link sap.m.WrappingType WrappingType.Hyphenated}`
         * property.
         *
         * As the class is singleton, an instance should be acquired from {@link sap.ui.core.hyphenation.Hyphenation#sap.ui.core.hyphenation.Hyphenation.getInstance
         * Hyphenation#getInstance}.
         *
         * Usage: When to use::
         * 	 - To check if browser-native hyphenation is available for particular language.
         * 	 - To hyphenate texts if browser-native hyphenation is not available.  When not to use::
         * 	 -  If the use case is covered by controls that support the property `wrappingType:{@link sap.m.WrappingType
         * 			WrappingType.Hyphenated}`. This functionality is supported by {@link sap.m.Title sap.m.Title}, {@link
         * 			sap.m.Label sap.m.Label} and {@link sap.m.Text sap.m.Text}.
         * 	 - If browser-native hyphenation is available
         *
         * Example:
         * ```javascript
         *
         * if (!Hyphenation.getInstance().canUseNativeHyphenation("en")) {
         * 	Hyphenation.getInstance().initialize("en").then(function() {
         * 		console.log(Hyphenation.getInstance().hyphenate("An example text to hyphenate.", "en"));
         * 	});
         * }
         * ```
         *
         *
         * For more information, see {@link topic:6322164936f047de941ec522b95d7b70 Hyphenation for Text Controls}.
         *
         * `Caution:` Note that as the hyphenation feature uses third-party and browser-native tools, we are not
         * responsible for any grammatical incorrectness or inconsistencies of the hyphenation. Also, the variety
         * of supported languages is outside the scope of our control and may be subject to future changes.

           * function which opts in to this mechanism. Candidates for such formatter functions are all those used
           * in binding expressions which are evaluated during XML template processing, including those used inside
           * template instructions like `<template:if>`. The formatter function needs to be marked with a property
           * `requiresIContext = true` to express that it requires this extended signature (compared to ordinary formatter
           * functions). The usual arguments are provided after the first one (currently: the raw value from the model).
           *
           * This interface provides callback functions to access the model and path which are needed to process OData
           * V4 annotations. It initially offers a subset of methods from {@link sap.ui.model.Context} so that formatters
           * might also be called with a context object for convenience, e.g. outside of XML template processing (see
           * below for an exception to this rule).
           *
           * **Example:** Suppose you have a formatter function called "foo" like below and it is used within an XML
           * template like `<template:if test="{path: '...', formatter: 'foo'}">`. In this case `foo` is called
           * with arguments `oInterface, vRawValue` such that `oInterface.getModel().getObject(oInterface.getPath())
           * === vRawValue` holds.
           * ```javascript
           *
           * window.foo = function (oInterface, vRawValue) {
           *     //TODO ...
           * };
           * window.foo.requiresIContext = true;
           * ```
           *
           *
           * **Composite Binding Examples:** Suppose you have the same formatter function and it is used in a composite
           * binding like `<Text text="{path: 'Label', formatter: 'foo'}: {path: 'Value', formatter: 'foo'}"/>`.
           * In this case `oInterface.getPath()` refers to ".../Label" in the 1st call and ".../Value" in the 2nd
           * call. This means each formatter call knows which part of the composite binding it belongs to and behaves
           * just as if it was an ordinary binding.
           *
           * Suppose your formatter is not used within a part of the composite binding, but at the root of the composite
           * binding in order to aggregate all parts like ` <Text text="{parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}],
           * formatter: 'foo'}"/>`. In this case `oInterface.getPath(0)` refers to ".../Label" and `oInterface.getPath(1)`
           * refers to ".../Value". This means, the root formatter can access the ith part of the composite binding
           * at will (since 1.31.0); see also {@link #.getInterface getInterface}. The function `foo` is called with
           * arguments such that ` oInterface.getModel(i).getObject(oInterface.getPath(i)) === arguments[i + 1]` holds.
           * This use is not supported within an expression binding, that is, `<Text text="{= ${parts: [{path:
           * 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}], formatter: 'foo'} }"/>` does not work as expected because the property `requiresIContext
           * = true` is ignored.
           *
           * To distinguish those two use cases, just check whether `oInterface.getModel() === undefined`, in which
           * case the formatter is called on root level of a composite binding. To find out the number of parts, probe
           * for the smallest non-negative integer where `oInterface.getModel(i) === undefined`. This additional functionality
           * is, of course, not available from {@link sap.ui.model.Context}, i.e. such formatters MUST be called with
           * an instance of this context interface.

             *
             *

             *  A formatter which is not at the root level of a composite binding can also provide a path, but must

         *   [...]

         *  The syntax of the configuration object of the component usage matches the configuration object of the
         * {#link sap.ui.component} factory function.
         *
         * This is an example of how the `createComponent` function can be used for asynchronous scenarios:
         * ```javascript
         *
         * oComponent.createComponent("myUsage").then(function(oComponent) {
         *   oComponent.doSomething();

         * });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * The following example shows how `createComponent` can be used to create a nested component by providing
         * specific properties like `id`, `async`, `settings`, or `componentData`:
         * ```javascript
         *
         * var oComponent = oComponent.createComponent({

         *   settings: { ... },
         *   componentData: { ... }
         * });
         * ```
         *  The allowed list of properties are defined in the parameter documentation of this function.
         *
         * The properties can also be defined in the descriptor. These properties can be overwritten by the local

         * be used in the Component and the name of the service factory which will be used to create a service instance.
         *
         * The `getService` function will look up the service factory and will create a new instance by using the
         * service factory function {@link sap.ui.core.service.ServiceFactory#createInstance createInstance} The

         * will be no error logged in the console.
         *
         * When creating a new instance of the service the Component context will be passed as `oServiceContext`

         * ```
         *
         *
         * The service will be created only once per Component and reused in future calls to the `getService` function.

         * before any language dependent objects are created. Applications that need to support more dynamic changes

         * that they use (e.g. by rebuilding their UI).
         *
         * Currently, the framework notifies the following objects about a change of the localization settings before
         * it fires the `localizationChanged` event:
         *
         *
         * 	 - date and number data types that are used in property bindings or composite bindings in existing Elements,
         * 			Controls, UIAreas or Components
         * 	 - ResourceModels currently assigned to the Core, a UIArea, Component, Element or Control
         * 	 - Elements or Controls that implement the `onlocalizationChanged` hook (note the lowercase 'l' in onlocalizationChanged)
         *
         *
         * It furthermore derives the RTL mode from the new language, if no explicit RTL mode has been set. If the
         * RTL mode changes, the following additional actions will be taken:
         *
         *
         * 	 - the URLs of already loaded library theme files will be changed
         * 	 - the `dir` attribute of the page will be changed to reflect the new mode.
         * 	 - all UIAreas will be invalidated (which results in a rendering of the whole UI5 UI)
         *
         * This method does not accept SAP language codes for `sLanguage`. Instead, a second parameter `sSAPLogonLanguage`
         * can be provided with an SAP language code corresponding to the given language. A given value will be
         * returned by the {@link #getSAPLogonLanguage} method. It is up to the caller to provide a consistent pair
         * of BCP47 language and SAP language code. The SAP language code is only checked to be of length 2 and

       * 			of rendering the control (its 'Renderer').
       * 	 - **show / hide**: a control can be hidden, although it is still part of the control tree, see property
       * 			{@link #getVisible visible}
       * 	 - **local busy indicator**: marks a control visually as 'busy', see properties {@link #getBusy busy}
       * 			and {@link #getBusyIndicatorDelay busyIndicatorDelay}
       * 	 - **field groups**: by assigning the same group ID to a set of editable controls, they form a group
       * 			which can be validated together. See property {@link #getFieldGroupIds fieldGroupIds} and event {@link
       * 			#event:validateFieldGroup validateFieldGroup}. The term field was chosen as most often this feature
       * 			will be used to group editable fields in a form.
       * 	 - **custom style classes**: all controls allow to add custom CSS classes to their rendered DOM without
       * 			modifying their renderer code. See methods {@link #addStyleClass addStyleClass}, {@link #removeStyleClass
       * 			removeStyleClass}, {@link #toggleStyleClass toggleStyleClass} and {@link #hasStyleClass hasStyleClass}.
       *  The necessary implementation is encapsulated in {@link sap.ui.core.CustomStyleClassSupport CustomStyleClassSupport}
       * and can be applied to selected element classes as well.
       * 	 - **browser events**: by calling the methods {@link #attachBrowserEvent attachBrowserEvent} and {@link
       * 			#detachBrowserEvent detachBrowserEvent}, consumers can let the control class take care of registering
       * 			/ de-registering a given set of event listeners to the control's root DOM node. The framework will adapt

       * formatError}, {@link #event:validationSuccess validationSuccess}).

       * ```javascript
       *

         * This method is intended to be called exactly once while the main module of a library (its `library.js`
         * module) is executing, typically at its begin. The single parameter `oLibInfo` is an info object that
         * describes the content of the library.
         *
         * When the `oLibInfo` has been processed, a normalized version of it will be kept and will be returned
         * as library information in later calls to {@link #getLoadedLibraries}. Finally, `initLibrary` fires (the
         * currently private) {@link #event:LibraryChanged} event with operation 'add' for the newly loaded library.
         *
         * Side Effects:
         *
         * While analyzing the `oLibInfo`, the framework takes some additional actions:
         *
         *
         * 	 - If the info object contains a list of `interfaces`, they will be registered with the {@link sap.ui.base.DataType}
         * 			class to make them available as aggregation types in managed objects.
         *
         *
         * 	 - If the object contains a list of `controls` or `elements`, {@link sap.ui.lazyRequire lazy stubs}
         * 			will be created for their constructor as well as for their static `extend` and `getMetadata` methods.
         *  **Note:** Future versions might abandon the concept of lazy stubs as it requires synchronous XMLHttpRequests
         * which have been deprecated (see {@link http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org}). To be on the safe side, productive
         * applications should always require any modules that they directly depend on.
         *
         *
         * 	 - With the `noLibraryCSS` property, the library can be marked as 'theming-free'. Otherwise, the framework
         * 			will add a <link> tag to the page's head, pointing to the library's theme-specific stylesheet.
         * 			The creation of such a <link> tag can be suppressed with the {@link sap.ui.core.Configuration global
         * 			configuration option} `preloadLibCss`. It can contain a list of library names for which no stylesheet
         * 			should be included. This is e.g. useful when an application merges the CSS for multiple libraries and
         * 			already loaded the resulting stylesheet.
         *
         *
         * 	 - If a list of library `dependencies` is specified in the info object, those libraries will be loaded
         * 			synchronously by `initLibrary`.
         *  **Note:** Dependencies between libraries don't have to be modeled as AMD dependencies. Only when enums
         * or types from an additional library are used in the coding of the `library.js` module, the library should
         * be additionally listed in the AMD dependencies.
         *
         * Last but not least, higher layer frameworks might want to include their own metadata for libraries. The
         * property `extensions` might contain such additional metadata. Its structure is not defined by the framework,
         * but it is strongly suggested that each extension only occupies a single property in the `extensions`
         * object and that the name of that property contains some namespace information (e.g. library name that
         * introduces the feature) to avoid conflicts with other extensions. The framework won't touch the content
         * of `extensions` but will make it available in the library info objects returned by {@link #getLoadedLibraries}.
         *
         * Relationship to Descriptor for Libraries (manifest.json):
         *
         * The information contained in `oLibInfo` is partially redundant to the content of the descriptor for the
         * same library (its `manifest.json` file). Future versions of UI5 might ignore the information provided
         * in `oLibInfo` and might evaluate the descriptor file instead. Library developers therefore should keep
         * the information in both files in sync.
         *
         * When the `manifest.json` is generated from the `.library` file (which is the default for UI5 libraries
         * built with Maven), then the content of the `.library` and `library.js` files must be kept in sync.

         * After preloading the bundle, dependency information from the bundle is evaluated and any missing libraries
         * are also preloaded.
         *
         * Only then the library entry module (named `your/lib/library.js`) will be required and executed.
         * The module is supposed to call `sap.ui.getCore().initLibrary(...)` providing the framework with additional
         * metadata about the library, e.g. its version, the set of contained enums, types, interfaces, controls
         * and elements and whether the library requires CSS. If the library requires CSS, a <link> will be
         * added to the page referring to the corresponding `library.css` stylesheet for the library and the current
         * theme.
         *
         * When the optional parameter `vUrl` is given as a string or when a configuration object is given with
         * a non-empty, string-valued property `url`, then that URL will be registered for the namespace of the
         * library and all resources will be loaded from that location. This is convenience for a call like
         * ```javascript
         *
         *   sap.ui.loader.config({
         *     paths: {
         *       "lib/with/slashes": vUrl
         *     }
         *   });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * When the given library has been loaded already, no further action will be taken, especially, a given
         * URL will not be registered! In the case of asynchronous loading, a Promise will be returned, but will
         * be resolved immediately.

         *
         * Uniqueness of IDs:
         *
         * Each `Element` must have an ID. If no `sId` or `mSettings.id` is given at construction time, a new ID
         * will be created automatically. The IDs of all elements that exist at the same time in the same window
         * must be different. Providing an ID which is already used by another element throws an error.
         *
         * When an element is created from a declarative source (e.g. XMLView), then an ID defined in that declarative
         * source needs to be unique only within the declarative source. Declarative views will prefix that ID with
         * their own ID (and some separator) before constructing the element. Programmatically created views (JSViews)
         * can do the same with the {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View#createId} API. Similarly, UIComponents can prefix
         * the IDs of elements created in their context with their own ID. Also see {@link sap.ui.core.UIComponent#getAutoPrefixId
         * UIComponent#getAutoPrefixId}.
         *
         * Settings: If the optional `mSettings` are given, they must be a JSON-like object (object literal) that
         * defines values for properties, aggregations, associations or events keyed by their name.
         *
         * **Valid Names:**
         *
         * The property (key) names supported in the object literal are exactly the (case sensitive) names documented
         * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the control and its base classes.
         * Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this usually is the plural name, whereas it is the singular
         * name in case of 0..1 relations.
         *
         * If a key name is ambiguous for a specific control class (e.g. a property has the same name as an event),
         * then this method prefers property, aggregation, association and event in that order. To resolve such
         * ambiguities, the keys can be prefixed with `aggregation:`, `association:` or `event:`. In that case the
         * keys must be quoted due to the ':'.
         *
         * Each subclass should document the set of supported names in its constructor documentation.
         *
         * **Valid Values:**
         *
         *
         * 	 - for normal properties, the value has to be of the correct simple type (no type conversion occurs)
         *
         * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated control or element type
         *
         * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type
         * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
         * 	 - 0..n associations are not supported yet
         * 	 - for events either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
         * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on.
         *
         * Special aggregation `dependents` is connected to the lifecycle management and databinding, but not rendered
         * automatically and can be used for popups or other dependent controls or elements. This allows the definition
         * of popup controls in declarative views and enables propagation of model and context information to them.
         *
         * Accepts an object literal `mSettings` that defines initial property values, aggregated and associated
         * objects as well as event handlers. See {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject#constructor} for a general description

         * Cleans up the rendering state of the given control without rendering it.
         *
         * A control is responsible for the rendering of all its child controls. But in some cases it makes sense
         * that a control only renders a subset of its children based on some criterion. For example, a typical
         * carousel control might, for performance reasons, only render the currently visible children (and maybe
         * some child before and after the visible area to facilitate slide-in / slide-out animations), but not
         * all children. This leads to situations where a child had been rendered before, but shouldn't be rendered
         * anymore after an update of the carousel's position. The DOM related state of that child then must be
         * cleaned up correctly, e.g. by de-registering resize handlers or native event handlers. `cleanupControlWithoutRendering`
         * helps with that task by triggering the same activities that the normal rendering triggers before the
         * rendering of a control (e.g. it fire the `BeforeRendering` event). It just doesn't call the renderer
         * and the control will not receive an `AfterRendering` event.
         *
         * The following example shows how `renderControl` and `cleanupControlWithoutRendering` should be used:
         *
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         *   CarouselRenderer.render = function(rm, oCarousel){
         *
         *     ...
         *
         *     oCarousel.getPages().forEach( oPage ) {
         *        if ( oCarousel.isPageToBeRendered( oPage ) ) {
         *           rm.renderControl( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering, render, later onAfterRendering
         *        } else {
         *           rm.cleanupControlWithoutRendering( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering
         *        }
         *     }
         *
         *     ...
         *
         *   };
         * ```
         *
         *
         * DOM Removal: The method does not remove the DOM of the given control. The caller of this method has to
         * take care to remove it at some later point in time. It should indeed be later, not before
         * as the `onBeforeRendering` hook of the control might need access to the old DOM for a proper cleanup.
         *
         * For parents which are rendered with the normal mechanism as shown in the example above, the removal of
         * the old child DOM is guaranteed. The whole DOM of the parent control (including the DOM of the no longer
         * rendered child) will be replaced with new DOM (no longer containing the child) when the rendering cycle
         * finishes.
         *
         * **Note:**: the functionality of this method is different from the default handling for invisible controls
         * (controls with `visible == false`). The standard rendering for invisible controls still renders a placeholder
         * DOM. This allows re-rendering of the invisible control once it becomes visible again without a need to
         * render its parent, too. Children that are cleaned up with this method here, are supposed to have no more
         * DOM at all. Rendering them later on therefore requires an involvement (typically: a rendering) of their
         * parent.

         * The following properties/values to ARIA attribute mappings are done (if the element does have such properties):
         *
         * 	 - `editable===false` => `aria-readonly="true"`

         * 	 - `checked===true` => `aria-checked="true"`
         *
         * In case of the required attribute also the Label controls which referencing the given element in their
         * 'for' relation are taken into account to compute the `aria-required` attribute.
         *
         * Additionally, the association `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy` are used to write the ID lists of
         * the ARIA attributes `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby`.
         *
         * Label controls that reference the given element in their 'for' relation are automatically added to the
         * `aria-labelledby` attributes.
         *
         * Note: This function is only a heuristic of a control property to ARIA attribute mapping. Control developers
         * have to check whether it fulfills their requirements. In case of problems (for example the RadioButton
         * has a `selected` property but must provide an `aria-checked` attribute) the auto-generated result of
         * this function can be influenced via the parameter `mProps` as described below.
         *
         * The parameter `mProps` can be used to either provide additional attributes which should be added and/or
         * to avoid the automatic generation of single ARIA attributes. The 'aria-' prefix will be prepended automatically
         * to the keys (Exception: Attribute 'role' does not get the prefix 'aria-').
         *
         * Examples: `{hidden : true}` results in `aria-hidden="true"` independent of the presence or absence of
         * the visibility property. `{hidden : null}` ensures that no `aria-hidden` attribute is written independent
         * of the presence or absence of the visibility property. The function behaves in the same way for the associations
         * `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy`. To append additional values to the auto-generated `aria-describedby`
         * and `aria-labelledby` attributes the following format can be used: `{describedby : {value: "id1 id2",
         * append: true}}` => `aria-describedby="ida idb id1 id2"` (assuming that "ida idb" is the auto-generated

       * but are implicitly created by the Core when controls are placed via {@link sap.ui.core.Control#placeAt
       * Control#placeAt} at a new DOM element for which no `UIArea` exists yet.
       *
       * `UIArea`s are essential for the rendering of controls. Controls get rendered only when they are directly
       * or indirectly contained in the `content` aggregation of a `UIArea`. `Control#placeAt` ensures that there
       * is a `UIArea` with the given ID and adds the control to the `content` aggregation of this `UIArea`. Whenever
       * controls become invalidated, the corresponding `UIArea` remembers this and takes care of the re-rendering
       * of the control.
       *
       * Additionally, `UIArea`s play an important role in the event handling of controls. They register for a
       * standard set of browser events. For each incoming event, they identify the control to which the target
       * of the event belongs to and dispatch the event to that control. This dispatching reduces the number of
       * event handlers in a page.
       *
       * `UIArea`s also act as a data binding root for their contained controls. Whenever a model is attached
       * to or detached from the Core, this change is propagated to all `UIAreas` which in turn propagate it further
       * down to their aggregated children, etc.
       *
       * The special aggregation named `dependents` also participates in the databinding, but its content is not
       * rendered by the `UIArea`. It can be used for popups or similar controls that are not contained in the
       * normal control tree, but nevertheless should receive model or binding context updates.

         * XMLComposite is the base class for composite controls that use a XML fragment representation for their
         * visual parts. From a user perspective such controls appear as any other control, but internally the rendering
         * part is added as a fragment. The fragment that is used should appear in the same folder as the control's
         * JS implementation with the file extension `.control.xml`. The fragment's content can access the interface
         * data from the XMLComposite control via bindings. Currently only aggregations and properties can be used
         * with bindings inside a fragment. The exposed model that is used for internal bindings in the fragment
         * has the default name `$this`. The name will always start with an `$`. The metadata of the derived control
         * can define the alias with its metadata. A code example can be found below.
         *
         * As XMLComposites compose other controls, they are only invalidated and re-rendered if explicitly defined.
         * Additional metadata for invalidation can be given for properties and aggregation. The default invalidation
         * is `"none"`. Setting invalidate to `true` for properties and aggregations sets the complete XMLComposite
         * to invalidate and rerender.
         *
         * Example:
         * ```javascript
         *
         * XMLComposite.extend("sap.mylib.MyXMLComposite", {
         *   metadata : {
         *     library: "sap.mylib",
         *     properties : {
         *       text: { //changing this property will not re-render the XMLComposite
         *          type: "string",
         *          defaultValue: ""
         *       },
         *       title: { //changing this property will re-render the XMLComposite as it defines invalidate: true
         *          type: "string",
         *          defaultValue: "",
         *          invalidate: true
         *       },
         *       value: { //changing this property will re-render the XMLComposite as it defines invalidate: true
         *          type: "string",
         *          defaultValue: "",
         *          invalidate: true
         *       }
         *     },

         *       header : {
         *          type: "sap.mylib.FancyHeader",
         *          multiple : false
         *       }
         *     },
         *     defaultAggregation : "items"
         *     events: {
         *       outerEvent : {
         *         parameters : {
         *           opener : "sap.ui.core.Control"
         *         }
         *       }
         *     }
         *   },
         *   //alias defaults to "this"
         *   alias: "mycontrolroot" //inner bindings will use model name $mycontrolroot
         *   //fragment defaults to {control name}.control.xml in this case sap.mylib.MyXMLComposite.control.xml
         *   fragment: "sap.mylib.MyXMLCompositeOther.control.xml" //the name of the fragment
         * });
         * ```
         *
         *
         * Internally the XMLComposite instantiates and initializes the given fragment and stores the resulting
         * control in a hidden aggregation named `_content`. The fragment should only include one root element.
         *
         * Bindings of inner controls to the interface of the XMLComposite can be done with normal binding syntax.
         * Here properties are used as property bindings and aggregations are used as list bindings. Currently it
         * is not possible to bind associations in a fragment.
         *
         * Example:
         * ```javascript
         *
         *    <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">
         *       <m:Text text="{$this>text}" visible="{= ${$this>text} !== ""}" />
         *    </core:FragmentDefinition>
         * ```
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         *    <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">
         *       <m:VBox items="{path:"$this>texts", filters:{path:"text", operator:"Contains", value1:"Text"}, sorter:{path:"text", descending:true}}">
         *           <m:Text text="{$this>text}" />
         *       </m:VBox>
         *    </core:FragmentDefinition>
         * ```
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         *    <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">
         *       <m:Button text="Press Me" press="handlePress"/>
         *    </core:FragmentDefinition>
         * ```
         *
         *
         * All events handled within the fragment will be dispatched to the XMLComposite control. It is recommended
         * to follow this paradigm to allow reuse of a XMLComposite without any dependency to controller code of
         * the current embedding view.
         *
         *
         * ```javascript
         *
         *    MyXMLComposite.prototype.handlePress = function() {
         *        this.fireOuterEvent(); // passing on the event to the outer view

         * types for both {@link http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/overview#AbstractTypeSystem
         * OData V2} and {@link http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part3-csdl.html OData V4}
         * (see "4.4 Primitive Types").
         *
         * They can be used in any place where simple types are allowed (and the model representation matches),
         * but they are of course most valuable when used in bindings to a {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel}
         * or {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel}.
         *
         * **Example:**
         * ```javascript
         *
         *   <Label text="ID"/>
         *   <Input value="{path : 'id', type : 'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String',
         *       constraints : {nullable : false, maxLength : 10}}"/>
         *   <Label text="valid through"/>
         *   <Input value="{path : 'validThrough', type : 'sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTime',
         *       constraints : {displayFormat : 'Date'}}"/>
         * ```
         *
         *
         * All types support formatting from the representation used in ODataModel ("model format") to various representations
         * used by UI elements ("target type") and vice versa. Additionally they support validating a given value
         * against the type's constraints.
         *
         * The following target types may be supported:  TypeDescription `string`The
         * value is converted to a `string`, so that it can be displayed in an input field. Supported by all types.
         * `boolean`The value is converted to a `Boolean`, so that it can be displayed in a checkbox.
         * Only supported by {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Boolean}. `int`The value
         * is converted to an integer (as `number`). May cause truncation of decimals and overruns. Supported by
         * all numeric types. `float`The value is converted to a `number`. Supported
         * by all numeric types. `any`A technical format. The value is simply passed
         * through. Only supported by `format`, not by `parse`. Supported by all types.
         *
         * All constraints relevant for OData V2 may be given as strings besides their natural types (e.g. `nullable
         * : "false"` or `maxLength : "10"`). This makes the life of template processors easier, but is not needed
         * for OData V4.
         *
         * **Handling of `null`**:
         *
         * All types handle `null` in the same way. When formatting to `string`, it is simply passed through (and
         * `undefined` becomes `null`, too). When parsing from `string`, it is also passed through. Additionally,
         * {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.String String} and {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Guid Guid} convert the
         * empty string to `null` when parsing. `validate` decides based on the constraint `nullable`: If `false`,
         * `null` is not accepted and leads to a (locale-dependent) `ParseException`.
         *
         * This ensures that the user cannot clear an input field bound to an attribute with non-nullable type.
         * However it does not ensure that the user really entered something if the field was empty before.
         *
         * **`Date` vs. `DateTime`**:
         *
         * The type {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.Date} is only valid for an OData V4 service. If you use the type
         * for an OData V2 service, displaying is possible but you get an error message from server if you try to
         * save changes.
         *
         * For an OData V2 service use {@link sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTime} with the constraint `displayFormat:
         * "Date"` to display only a date.

           * see the **"SAP Annotations for OData Version 2.0"** specification. The required property annotations
           * as well as accepted/default values are documented in this specification.
           *
           * Services which include the `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for` annotation and expose the data points
           * sorted in a depth-first, pre-order manner, can use an optimized auto-expand feature by specifying the
           * `numberOfExpandedLevels` in the binding parameters. This will pre-expand the hierarchy to the given number
           * of levels, with only a single initial OData request.
           *
           * For services without the `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for` annotation, the `numberOfExpandedLevels`
           * property is not supported and deprecated.
           *
           * Navigation Properties: **Note:** The use of navigation properties to build up the hierarchy structure
           * is deprecated and it is recommended to use the hierarchy annotations mentioned above instead.
           *
           * In addition to the hierarchy annotations, the `ODataTreeBinding` also supports (cyclic) references between
           * entities based on navigation properties. They have to be specified with the binding parameter `navigation`.
           * The value for that parameter has to be structured as a map object where the keys are entity names and
           * the values are names of navigation properties.
           *
           * Example:
           * ```javascript
           *
           *   oTree.bindItems({
           *
           *     path: "Employees",
           *     template: ...
           *
           * 	   parameters: {
           *       navigation: {
           *         "Employees": "toColleagues"
           *       }
           *     }
           *   });
           * ```
           *
           *
           * Operation Modes: For a full definition and explanation of all OData binding operation modes see {@link
           * sap.ui.model.odata.OperationMode}.
           *
           * OperationMode.Server: Filtering on the `ODataTreeBinding` is only supported with ({@link sap.ui.model.FilterType.Application
           * application filters}). However please be aware that this applies only to filters which do not prevent
           * the creation of a hierarchy. So filtering on a property (e.g. a "Customer") is fine, as long as the application
           * can ensure that the responses from the backend are sufficient to create a valid hierarchy on the client.
           * Subsequent paging requests for sibling and child nodes must also return responses since the filters will
           * be sent with every request. Using control-defined filters ({@link sap.ui.model.FilterType.Control FilterType.Control})
           * via the `filter()` function is not supported for the operation mode `Server`.
           *
           * OperationMode.Client and OperationMode.Auto: The ODataTreeBinding supports control-defined filters only
           * in operation modes `Client` and `Auto`. In these operation modes, the filters and sorters will be applied
           * on the client, like for the `v2.ODataListBinding`.
           *
           * The operation modes `Client` and `Auto` are only supported for services which expose the hierarchy annotations
           * mentioned above, but do **not** expose the `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for` annotation. Services

             * data binding expression; this allows local annotation files to refer to a resource bundle for internationalization.
             *  the dynamic "14.5.1 Comparison and Logical Operators": These are turned into expression bindings
             * to perform the operations at run-time.  the dynamic "14.5.3 Expression edm:Apply":

             * at run-time.  Apply functions may be nested arbitrarily.   the dynamic "14.5.6 Expression
             * edm:If": This is turned into an expression binding to be evaluated at run-time. The expression is a conditional
             * expression like `"{=condition ? expression1 : expression2}"`.  the dynamic "14.5.10 Expression edm:Null":

           * Context binding for an OData V4 model. An event handler can only be attached to this binding for the
           * following events: 'AggregatedDataStateChange', 'change', 'dataReceived', 'dataRequested', and 'DataStateChange'.
           * For other events, an error is thrown.
           *
           * A context binding can also be used as an operation binding to support bound actions, action imports,
           * bound functions and function imports. If you want to control the execution time of an operation, for
           * example a function import named "GetNumberOfAvailableItems", create a context binding for the path "/GetNumberOfAvailableItems(...)"
           * (as specified here, including the three dots). Such an operation binding is deferred, meaning
           * that it does not request automatically, but only when you call {@link #execute}. {@link #refresh} is
           * always ignored for actions and action imports. For bound functions and function imports, it is ignored
           * if {@link #execute} has not yet been called. Afterwards it results in another call of the function with
           * the parameter values of the last execute.
           *
           * The binding parameter for bound actions or bound functions may be given in the binding path, for example
           * "/SalesOrderList('42')/name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm". This can be used if the exact entity for the binding
           * parameter is known in advance. If you use a relative binding instead, the operation path is a concatenation
           * of the parent context's canonical path and the deferred binding's path.
           *
           * **Example**: You have a table with a list binding to "/SalesOrderList". In each row you have a button
           * to confirm the sales order, with the relative binding "name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm(...)". Then the
           * parent context for such a button refers to an entity in "SalesOrderList", so its canonical path is "/SalesOrderList('SalesOrderID')"
           * and the resulting path for the action is "/SalesOrderList('SalesOrderID')/name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm".
           *
           * This also works if the relative path of the deferred operation binding starts with a navigation property.
           * Then this navigation property will be part of the operation's resource path, which is still valid.
           *
           * A deferred operation binding is not allowed to have another deferred operation binding as parent.

             * entity created via this function, you cannot create another entity. This is only possible after the creation
             * of the entity has been successfully sent to the server and you have called {@link #refresh} at the (parent)
             * binding, which is absolute or not relative to a {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context}, or the new entity
             * is deleted in between.
             *
             * For creating the new entity, the binding's update group ID is used, see binding parameter $$updateGroupId
             * of {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#bindList}.
             *
             * You can call {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete} to delete the created context again. As long
             * as the context is transient (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#isTransient}), {@link #resetChanges}
             * and a call to {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#resetChanges} with the update group ID as parameter
             * also delete the created context together with other changes.
             *
             * If the creation of the entity on the server failed, the creation is repeated automatically. If the binding's
             * update group ID has {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.SubmitMode.API}, it is repeated with the next call of
             * {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#submitBatch}. Otherwise it is repeated with the next update for
             * the entity.
             *
             * The initial data for the created entity can be supplied via the parameter `oInitialData` and modified
             * via property bindings. Properties that are not part of the initial data show the default value from the
             * service metadata on the UI, but they are not sent to the server. If there is no default value, `null`
             * is used instead, even if the property is not `Nullable`.
             *
             * Note: If a server requires a property in the request, you must supply this property in the initial data,
             * for example if the server requires a unit for an amount. This also applies if this property has a default
             * value.
             *
             * Note: After creation, the created entity is refreshed to ensure that the data specified in this list
             * binding's $expand is available; to skip this refresh, set `bSkipRefresh` to `true`.

             *
             *
             * The basic idea is that every path described in "14.2.1 Attribute Target" in specification "OData Version
             * 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language" is a valid absolute path within the metadata model if
             * a leading slash is added; for example "/" + "MySchema.MyEntityContainer/MyEntitySet/MyComplexProperty/MyNavigationProperty".
             * Also, every path described in "14.5.2 Expression edm:AnnotationPath", "14.5.11 Expression edm:NavigationPropertyPath",
             * "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path", and "14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath" is a valid relative path within
             * the metadata model if a suitable prefix is added which addresses an entity container, entity set, singleton,
             * complex type, entity type, or property; for example "/MySchema.MyEntityType/MyProperty" + "@vCard.Address#work/FullName".
             *
             * The absolute path is split into segments and followed step-by-step, starting at the global scope of all
             * known qualified OData names. There are two technical properties there: "$Version" (typically "4.0") and
             * "$EntityContainer" with the name of the single entity container for this metadata model's service.
             *
             * An empty segment in between is invalid. An empty segment at the end caused by a trailing slash differentiates
             * between a name and the object it refers to. This way, "/$EntityContainer" refers to the name of the single
             * entity container and "/$EntityContainer/" refers to the single entity container as an object.
             *
             * The segment "@sapui.name" refers back to the last OData name (simple identifier or qualified name) or
             * annotation name encountered during path traversal immediately before "@sapui.name":
             * 	 "/EMPLOYEES@sapui.name" results in "EMPLOYEES" and "/EMPLOYEES/@sapui.name" results in the same as
             * "/EMPLOYEES/$Type", that is, the qualified name of the entity set's type (see below how "$Type" is inserted
             * implicitly). Note how the separating slash again makes a difference here.  "/EMPLOYEES/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label@sapui.name"
             * results in "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label" and a slash does not make any difference as long as
             * the annotation does not have a "$Type" property.  A technical property (that is, a numerical segment
             * or one starting with a "$") immediately before "@sapui.name" is invalid, for example "/$EntityContainer@sapui.name".
             *  The path must not continue after "@sapui.name".
             *
             * If the current object is a string value, that string value is treated as a relative path and followed
             * step-by-step before the next segment is processed. Except for this, a path must not continue if it comes
             * across a non-object value. Such a string value can be a qualified name (example path "/$EntityContainer/..."),
             * a simple identifier (example path "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...") or even a
             * path according to "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" etc. (example path "/TEAMS/$Type/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/...").
             *
             * Segments starting with an "@" character, for example "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label", address
             * annotations at the current object. As the first segment, they refer to the single entity container. For
             * objects which can only be annotated inline (see "14.3 Element edm:Annotation" minus "14.2.1 Attribute
             * Target"), the object already contains the annotations as a property. For objects which can (only or also)
             * be annotated via external targeting, the object does not contain any annotation as a property. Such annotations
             * MUST be accessed via a path. BEWARE of a special case: Actions, functions and their parameters can be
             * annotated inline for a single overload or via external targeting for all overloads at the same time.
             * In this case, the object contains all annotations for the single overload as a property, but annotations
             * MUST nevertheless be accessed via a path in order to include also annotations for all overloads at the
             * same time.
             *
             * Segments starting with an OData name followed by an "@" character, for example "/TEAMS@Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.TopSupported",
             * address annotations at an entity set, singleton, or property, not at the corresponding type. In contrast,
             * "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Deletable" (note the separating slash) addresses an annotation
             * at the entity set's type. This is in line with the special rule of "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" regarding
             * annotations at a navigation property itself.
             *
             * "@" can be used as a segment to address a map of all annotations of the current object. This is useful
             * for iteration, for example via `<template:repeat list="{entityType>@}" ...>`.
             *
             * Annotations of an annotation are addressed not by two separate segments, but by a single segment like
             * "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TextArrangement". Each annotation
             * can have a qualifier, for example "@first#foo@second#bar". Note: If the first annotation's value is a
             * record, a separate segment addresses an annotation of that record, not an annotation of the first annotation
             * itself. In a similar way, annotations of "7.2 Element edm:ReferentialConstraint", "7.3 Element edm:OnDelete",
             * "10.2 Element edm:Member" and "14.5.14.2 Element edm:PropertyValue" are addressed by segments like "<7.2.1
             * Attribute Property>@...", "$OnDelete@...", "<10.2.1 Attribute Name>@..." and "<14.5.14.2.1 Attribute
             * Property>@..." (where angle brackets denote a variable part and sections refer to specification "OData
             * Version 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language").
             *
             * Annotations starting with "@@", for example "@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple" or
             * "@@.AH.isMultiple" or "@@.isMultiple", represent computed annotations. Their name without the "@@" prefix
             * must refer to a function in `mParameters.scope` in case of a relative name starting with a dot, which
             * is stripped before lookup; see the `<template:alias>` instruction for XML Templating. In case of an
             * absolute name, it is searched in `mParameters.scope` first and then in the global namespace. This function
             * is called with the current object (or primitive value) and additional details and returns the result
             * of this {@link #requestObject} call. The additional details are given as an object with the following
             * properties:
             * 	`{boolean} $$valueAsPromise` Whether the computed annotation may return a `Promise` resolving with its
             * value (since 1.57.0) `{@link sap.ui.model.Context} context` Points to the current object `{string}
             * schemaChildName` The qualified name of the schema child where the computed annotation has been found
             *  Computed annotations cannot be iterated by "@". The path must not continue after a computed annotation.
             *
             * A segment which represents an OData qualified name is looked up in the global scope ("scope lookup")
             * and thus determines a schema child which is used later on. Unknown qualified names are invalid. This
             * way, "/acme.DefaultContainer/EMPLOYEES" addresses the "EMPLOYEES" child of the schema child named "acme.DefaultContainer".
             * This also works indirectly ("/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES") and implicitly ("/EMPLOYEES", see below).
             *
             * A segment which represents an OData simple identifier needs special preparations. The same applies to
             * the empty segment after a trailing slash.   If the current object has a "$Action", "$Function"
             * or "$Type" property, it is used for scope lookup first. This way, "/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE" addresses the
             * same object as "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/ENTRYDATE", namely the "ENTRYDATE" child of the entity type corresponding
             * to the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container. The other cases jump from an action or function import
             * to the corresponding action or function overloads.  Else if the segment is the first one within its
             * path, the last schema child addressed via scope lookup is used instead of the current object. This can
             * only happen indirectly as in "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/..." where the schema
             * child is the entity container and the navigation property binding can contain the simple identifier of
             * another entity set within the same container.
             *
             * If the segment is the first one overall, "$EntityContainer" is inserted into the path implicitly. In
             * other words, the entity container is used as the initial schema child. This way, "/EMPLOYEES" addresses
             * the same object as "/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES", namely the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container.
             *  Afterwards, if the current object is an array, it represents overloads for an action or function.
             * Multiple overloads are invalid. The overload's "$ReturnType/$Type" is used for scope lookup. This way,
             * "/GetOldestWorker/AGE" addresses the same object as "/GetOldestWorker/0/$ReturnType/$Type/AGE". For primitive
             * return types, the special segment "value" can be used to refer to the return type itself (see {@link
             * sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute}). This way, "/GetOldestAge/value" addresses the same
             * object as "/GetOldestAge/0/$ReturnType" (which is needed for automatic type determination, see {@link
             * #requestUI5Type}).
             *
             * A trailing slash can be used to continue a path and thus force scope lookup or OData simple identifier
             * preparations, but then stay at the current object. This way, "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/" addresses the entity
             * type itself corresponding to the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container. Although the empty segment
             * is not an OData simple identifier, it can be used as a placeholder for one. In this way, "/EMPLOYEES/"
             * addresses the same entity type as "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/". That entity type in turn is a map of all its OData
             * children (that is, structural and navigation properties) and determines the set of possible child names
             * that might be used after the trailing slash.
             *
             * Any other segment, including an OData simple identifier, is looked up as a property of the current object.

         * This model is read-only and thus only supports {@link sap.ui.model.BindingMode.OneTime OneTime} binding
         * mode. No events ({@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:parseError parseError}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestCompleted
         * requestCompleted}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestFailed requestFailed}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestSent
         * requestSent}) are fired!
         *
         * Within the meta model, the objects are arranged in arrays. `/dataServices/schema`, for example, is an
         * array of schemas where each schema has an `entityType` property with an array of entity types, and so
         * on. So, `/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/16` can be the path to the entity type with name "Order" in
         * the schema with namespace "MySchema". However, these paths are not stable: If an entity type with lower
         * index is removed from the schema, the path to `Order` changes to `/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/15`.
         *
         * To avoid problems with changing indexes, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#getObject getObject} and {@link sap.ui.model.Model#getProperty
         * getProperty} support XPath-like queries for the indexes (since 1.29.1). Each index can be replaced by
         * a query in square brackets. You can, for example, address the schema using the path `/dataServices/schema/[${namespace}==='MySchema']`
         * or the entity using `/dataServices/schema/[${namespace}==='MySchema']/entityType/[${name}==='Order']`.
         *
         * The syntax inside the square brackets is the same as in expression binding. The query is executed for
         * each object in the array until the result is true (truthy) for the first time. This object is then chosen.
         *
         * **BEWARE:** Access to this OData meta model will fail before the promise returned by {@link #loaded loaded}
         * has been resolved!

             * matcher and the internal autoWait logic will check if the Control is currently able to perform actions
             * if it is not, Opa5 will try again after the 'pollingInterval'. That means actions will only be executed

             * 	 -  There is no pending asynchronous work performed by the application   If there are multiple
             * 			controls in Opa5's result set the action will be executed on all of them. The actions will be invoked
             * 			directly before success is called. In the documentation of the success parameter there is a list of conditions

             * 			the success handler will not be executed until the waitFor of the action has finished. An example:
             *
             * ```javascript
             *
             *     this.waitFor({

             *            this.waitFor({
             *              id: "anotherButton",
             *              actions: function () {
             *                // This is the second function that will be executed
             *                // Opa will also wait until anotherButton is Interactable before executing this function
             *              },
             *              success: function () {
             *                // This is the third function that will be executed
             *              }
             *            })
             *         },

             *             // This is the fourth function that will be executed
             *         }
             *     });
             *     ```
             *   Executing multiple actions will not wait between actions for a control to become "Interactable"

             * example: open XMLHTTPRequests (requests to a server), scheduled delayed work and promises, unfinished
             * UI navigation. In addition, the control must be {@link sap.ui.test.matchers.Interactable} So when autoWait
             * is enabled, success behaves like an action in terms of waiting. It is recommended to set this value to
             * true for all your waitFor statements using:
             * ```javascript
             *
             *     Opa5.extendConfig({
             *         autoWait: true
             *     });
             *     ```
             *   Why is it recommended: When writing a huge set of tests and executing them frequently you might
             * face tests that are sometimes successful but sometimes they are not. Setting the autoWait to true should
             * stabilize most of those tests. The default "false" could not be changed since it causes existing tests
             * to fail. There are cases where you do not want to wait for controls to be "Interactable": For example
             * when you are testing the Busy indication of your UI during the sending of a request. But these cases
             * are the exception so it is better to explicitly adding autoWait: false to this waitFor.
             * ```javascript
             *
             *     this.waitFor({
             *         id: "myButton",
             *         autoWait: false,

             *              Opa5.assert.ok(oButton.getBusy(), "My Button was busy");
             *         }
             *     });
             *     ```
             *   This is also the easiest way of migrating existing tests. First extend the config, then see
             * which waitFors will time out and finally disable autoWait in these Tests.

         * in order to e.g. run tests on each of them.
         *
         * It is used by calling the static `run` function with a callback function as parameter. This function
         * will be called for each control (and provide control name and class and more information about the control
         * as arguments), so a test could be executed for this control.
         *
         * The second parameter of the `run` function can be used to configure several options, e.g. to define a
         * hard-coded list of control libraries to test (otherwise all available libraries are discovered), to exclude
         * certain controls or libraries, to state whether sap.ui.core.Elements should also be tested, etc. Check
         * the documentation of the `run` function parameters to understand which Controls/Elements are used by
         * default and which ones are excluded.
         *
         * The `run` function does NOT execute synchronously! In case a QUnit test function is written that embeds
         * a call to `run` (as opposed to creating a test function inside each callback), this test function needs
         * to be asynchronous and needs to use the `done` callback option (called when all control tests have been
         * executed) to call `done()` (the function returned by `assert.async()`).
