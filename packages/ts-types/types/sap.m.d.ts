     * As `MessageBox` is a static class, a `sap.ui.require("sap/m/MessageBox");` statement must be explicitly

     * 			- predefined templates of MessageBoxes of the corresponding type with predefined action buttons and icon.
     * 			Only the recommended options are documented for those functions.  **NOTE:** All options of show()
     * 			are available for the other template functions as well, but it is recommended to use show() only in more
     * 			specific scenarios. Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * 	sap.ui.define(["sap/m/MessageBox"], function(MessageBox) {
     * 		MessageBox.show(
     * 			"This message should appear in the message box.", {

     *
     * A small, non-disruptive popup for messages. Overview: A message toast is a small, non-disruptive popup
     * for success or information messages that disappears automatically after a few seconds. Toasts automatically
     * disappear after a timeout unless the user moves the mouse over the toast or taps on it. Notes::
     *
     * 	 - If the configured message contains HTML code or script tags, those will be escaped.
     * 	 - Line breaks (\r\n, \n\r, \r, \n) will be visualized.
     * 	 - Only one message toast can be shown at a time in the same place.  Example:: Here is an example
     * 			of a MessageToast with all default options:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.m.MessageToast.show("This message should appear in the message toast", {
     *     duration: 3000,                  // default
     *     width: "15em",                   // default
     *     my: "center bottom",             // default
     *     at: "center bottom",             // default
     *     of: window,                      // default
     *     offset: "0 0",                   // default
     *     collision: "fit fit",            // default
     *     onClose: null,                   // default
     *     autoClose: true,                 // default
     *     animationTimingFunction: "ease", // default
     *     animationDuration: 1000,         // default
     *     closeOnBrowserNavigation: true   // default
     * });
     * ```
     *  Usage: When to use::
     * 	 - You want to display a short success of information message.
     * 	 - You do not want to interrupt users while they are performing an action.
     * 	 - You want to confirm a successful action.  When not to use::
     * 	 - You want to display an error or warning message.
     * 	 - You want to interrupt users while they are performing an action.
     * 	 - You want to make sure that users read the message before they leave the page.
     * 	 - You want users to be able to copy some part of the message text. (In this case, show a success {@link
     * 			sap.m.Dialog Message Dialog}.)  Responsive Behavior: The message toast has the same behavior on
     * 			all devices. However, you can adjust the width of the control, for example, for use on a desktop device.

       * The functionality of the routematched handler is built in into these two classes, there is no need to
       * create this anymore.
       *
       * This class will attach to the Events of a provided router and add the views created by it to a {@link
       * sap.m.SplitContainer} or a {@link sap.m.NavContainer} Control, if this is the target control of the route.
       *  If the targetControl is no {@link sap.m.SplitContainer} or a {@link sap.m.NavContainer}, It will only
       * close the dialogs, according to the property value.
       *
       *  When a navigation is triggered, this class will try to determine the transition of the pages based on
       * the history.
       *  Eg: if a user presses browser back, it will show a backwards animation.
       *
       *  The navigation on the container takes place in the RoutePatternMatched event of the Router. If you register
       * on the RouteMatched event of the Router, the visual navigation did not take place yet.
       *
       *  Since it is hard to detect if a user has pressed browser back, this transitions will not be reliable,
       * for example if someone bookmarked a detail page, and wants to navigate to a masterPage.
       *  If you want this case to always show a backwards transition, you should specify a "viewLevel" property
       * on your Route.
       *  The viewLevel has to be an integer. The Master should have a lower number than the detail.
       *  These levels should represent the user process of your application and they do not have to match the
       * container structure of your Routes.
       *  If the user navigates between views with the same viewLevel, the history is asked for the direction.
       *
       *  You can specify a property "transition" in a route to define which transition will be applied when navigating.
       * If it is not defined, the nav container will take its default transition.
       *  You can also specify "transitionParameters" on a Route, to give the transition parameters.
       *
       *  preservePageInSplitContainer is deprecated since 1.28 since Targets make this parameter obsolete. If
       * you want to preserve the current view when navigating, but you want to navigate to it when nothing is
       * displayed in the navContainer, you can set preservePageInSplitContainer = true
       *  When the route that has this flag directly matches the pattern, the view will still be switched by the
       * splitContainer.

       * An enhanced {@link sap.m.Page}, that can contain controls with semantic meaning, see {@link sap.m.semantic.SemanticControl}.
       *
       * **Note:** This control implements the SAP Fiori 1.0 design guidelines. For SAP Fiori 2.0, see the {@link
       * sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage}.
       *
       * Overview:
       *
       * The main functionality of the `SemanticPage` is to predefine the placement, behavior and styles of the
       * page elements.
       *
       * Content specified in the semantic aggregations will be automatically positioned in dedicated sections
       * of the footer or the header of the page.
       *
       * Structure:
       *
       * The semantics of the content are the following:
       * 	 - Visual properties (for example, `AddAction` will be styled as an icon button)
       * 	 - Position in the page (UX guidelines specify that some buttons should be in the header only, while
       * 			others are in the footer or the "share" menu, so we do the correct positioning)
       * 	 - Sequence order (UX guidelines define a specific sequence order of semantic controls with respect
       * 			to each other)
       * 	 - Default localized tooltip for icon-only buttons
       * 	 - Overflow behavior (UX guidelines define which buttons are allowed to go to the overflow of the toolbar
       * 			when the screen gets narrower). For icon buttons, we ensure that the text label of the button appears
       * 			when the button is in overflow, as specified by UX.
       * 	 - Screen reader support (invisible text for reading the semantic type)
       *
       * In addition to the predefined semantic controls, the `SemanticPage` can host also custom app controls.
       * It preserves most of the API of the {@link sap.m.Page} for specifying page content.
       *
       * Usage:
       *
       * The app developer only has to specify the action type, and the required styling and positioning are automatically
       * added.

     *
     *
     * 	 - `autoCloseEvents` - An array of strings, listing all of the control's events that should trigger
     * 			the closing of the overflow menu, when fired.
     *
     *
     * 	 - `invalidationEvents` - An array of strings, listing all of the control's events that should trigger
     * 			the invalidation of the `sap.m.OverflowToolbar`, when fired.
     *
     * `propsUnrelatedToSize` - An array of strings, listing all of the control's properties that, when
     * changed, should not cause the overflow toolbar to invalidate.
     *
     * **Note:** By default `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` invalidates whenever any property of a child control changes.
     * This is to ensure that whenever the size of a child control changes, the overflow toolbar's layout is
     * recalculated. Some properties however do not affect control size, making it unnecessary to invalidate
     * the overflow toolbar when they change. You can list them here for optimization purposes.
     *
     * `onBeforeEnterOverflow(oControl)` - A callback function that will be invoked before moving the control
     * into the overflow menu. The control instance will be passed as an argument.
     *
     * **Note:** The context of the function is not the control instance (use the `oControl` parameter for this
     * purpose), but rather an internal helper object, associated with the current `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` instance.
     * This object only needs to be manipulated in special cases (e.g. when you want to store state on it, rather
     * than on the control instance).
     *
     * `onAfterExitOverflow(oControl)` - A callback function that will be invoked after taking the control
     * out of the overflow menu (before moving it back to the toolbar itself). The control instance will be
     * passed as an argument.
     *
     * **Note:** See: `onBeforeEnterOverflow` for details about the function's context.
     *
     * `getCustomImportance()` - A function that, if provided, will be called to determine the priority
     * of the control. This function must return a value of type `sap.m.OverflowToolbarPriority`. The string
     * "Medium" is also accepted and interpreted as priority between `Low` and High.
     *
     * **Note:** Normally priority in `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` is managed with the `priority` property of `sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData`.
     * However, some controls may have other means of defining priority, such as dedicated properties or other
     * types of layout data for that purpose. In summary, implementing this function allows a control to override
     * the default priority logic (`sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData`) by providing its own.
     *
     * **Important:** In addition, the control can implement a CSS class, scoped with the `.sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX`
     * context selector, that will be applied whenever the control is inside the overflow menu. For example,
     * to make your control take up the whole width of the overflow menu, you can add a context class to your
     * control's base CSS file like this:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *       .sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX .sapMyControlClass {
     *       	width: 100%;
     *       }
     *   ```

       *
       * Note that only the first attempt to set the homeIcon will be executed, subsequent settings are ignored.
       *
       * This icon must be in PNG format. The property can either hold the URL of one single icon which is used
       * for all devices (and possibly scaled, which looks not perfect), or an object holding icon URLs for the
       * different required sizes.
       *
       * A desktop icon (used for bookmarks and overriding the favicon) can also be configured. This requires
       * an object to be given and the "icon" property of this object then defines the desktop bookmark icon.
       * For this icon, PNG is not supported by Internet Explorer. The ICO format is supported by all browsers.
       * ICO is also preferred for this desktop icon setting because the file can contain different images for
       * different resolutions.
       *
       * One example is:
       *
       * app.setHomeIcon({ 'phone':'phone-icon.png', 'phone@2':'phone-retina.png', 'tablet':'tablet-icon.png',
       * 'tablet@2':'tablet-retina.png', 'icon':'desktop.ico' });
       *
       * The respective image sizes are 57/114 px for the phone and 72/144 px for the tablet. If an object is
       * given but one of the sizes is not given, the largest given icon will be used for this size.
       *
       * On Android these icons may or may not be used by the device. Apparently chances can be improved by adding
       * glare effect and rounded corners, setting the file name so it ends with "-precomposed.png" and setting
       * the "homeIconPrecomposed" property to "true".

     * such as a title, while having other controls on the left and right side.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * With the use of the `design` property, you can set the style of the `Bar` to appear as a header, sub-header
     * and footer.
     *
     * **Note:** Do not place a `sap.m.Bar` inside another `sap.m.Bar` or inside any bar-like control. Doing
     * so causes unpredictable behavior.
     *
     * Responsive Behavior:
     *
     * The content in the middle area is centrally positioned if there is enough space. If the right or left
     * content overlaps the middle content, the middle content will be centered in the space between.

     * 	 - Content area - displays the different items.
     * 	 - Navigation - arrows to the left and right for switching between items.
     * 	 - (optional) Paging - indicator at the bottom to show the current position in the set.  The paging
     * 			indicator can be configured as follows:
     * 	 - `showPageIndicator` - determines if the indicator is displayed.
     * 	 - If the pages are less than 9, the page indicator is represented with bullets.
     * 	 - If the pages are 9 or more, the page indicator is numeric.
     * 	 - `pageIndicatorPlacement` - determines where the indicator is located. Default (`sap.m.PlacementType.Bottom`)
     * 			- below the content.  Additionally, you can also change the location of the navigation arrows. By
     * 			setting `arrowsPlacement` to `sap.m.CarouselArrowsPlacement.PageIndicator`, the arrows will be located
     * 			at the bottom by the paging indicator. Usage:  When to use:
     * 	 - The items you want to display are very different from each other.
     * 	 - You want to display the items one after the other.   When not to use:
     * 	 - The items you want to display need to be visible at the same time.
     * 	 - The items you want to display are uniform and very similar  Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 - On touch devices, navigation is performed with swipe gestures (swipe right or swipe left).
     * 	 - On desktop, navigation is done with the navigation arrows.
     * 	 - The paging indicator (when activated) is visible on each form factor.

     * Allows the user to set a binary value, such as true/false or yes/no for an item.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `CheckBox` control consists of a box and a label that describes its purpose. If it's checked, an
     * indicator is displayed inside the box.
     *
     * To select/deselect the `CheckBox`, the user has to click or tap the square box or its label. Clicking
     * or tapping toggles the `CheckBox` between checked and unchecked state. The `CheckBox` control only has
     * 3 states - checked, unchecked and partially selected.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * You can set the width of the element containing the box and the label manually with the use of the `width`
     * property. If the text exceeds the available width, it is truncated.
     *
     * **Note:** When `useEntireWidth` property is set to `true`, the value of the `width` property is applied
     * to the control as a whole (box and label). If `useEntireWidth` is set to `false`, the `width` is applied
     * to the label only.
     *
     * The touchable area for toggling the `CheckBox` ends where the text ends.
     *
     * If the width allows more space than the text requires, white space is added. The text can be positioned
     * manually in this space using the `textAlign` property.
     *
     * **Note:** Keep in mind that setting the `textAlign` property to `Right` can result in a large amount
     * of white space between the box and the text.
     *
     * You can disable the `CheckBox` by setting the `enabled` property to `false`, or use the `CheckBox` in
     * read-only mode by setting the `editable` property to false.
     *
     * **Note:** Disabled and read-only states shouldn't be used together.

     * 			the list or enter their own value.

     * 	 -  Option list - the list of available options.  By setting the `showSecondaryValues` property,
     * 			the combo box can display an additional value for each option (if there is one). Usage: When to use::
     *
     * 	 - You need to select only one item in a long list of options (between 13 and 200) or your custom user
     * 			input.  When not to use::
     * 	 - You need to select between only two options. Use a {@link sap.m.Switch switch} control instead.
     * 	 - You need to select between up to 12 options. Use a {@link sap.m.Select select} control instead.
     * 	 - You need to select between more than 200 options. Use a {@link sap.m.Input input} control with value
     * 			help instead.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 - The width of the option list adapts to its content. The minimum width is the input field plus the
     * 			drop-down arrow.
     * 	 - There is no horizontal scrolling in the option list. Entries in the list that are too long will be
     * 			truncated.
     * 	 - On phone devices the combo box option list opens a dialog.

     * @SINCE 1.22.0
     *
     * Enables the users to select a localized date.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `DatePicker` lets the users select a localized date using touch, mouse, or keyboard input. It consists
     * of two parts: the date input field and the date picker.
     *
     * **Note:** The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the `DatePicker` is opened (not
     * used for the initial rendering). If the `sap.ui.unified` library is not loaded before the `DatePicker`
     * is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the `DatePicker` is
     * opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `DatePicker` should also load the `sap.ui.unified`
     * library.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * The user can enter a date by:
     * 	 - Using the calendar that opens in a popup
     * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field (not available for mobile devices)
     *
     * On app level, there are two options to provide a date for the `DatePicker` - as a string to the `value`
     * property or as a JavaScript Date object to the `dateValue` property (only one of these properties should
     * be used at a time):
     *
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if you want to bind the `DatePicker` to a model using the `sap.ui.model.type.Date`
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for
     * 			example, as ABAP type DATS field)
     * 	 - Use the `dateValue` property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want
     * 			to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use `dateValue` as a helper property to easily obtain the day,
     * 			month and year of the chosen date. Although possible to bind it, the recommendation is not to do it.
     * 			When binding is needed, use `value` property instead
     *
     * Formatting:
     *
     * All formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
     * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.
     *
     * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
     *
     * For example, if the `valueFormat` is "yyyy-MM-dd", the `displayFormat` is "MMM d, y", and the used locale
     * is English, a valid value string is "2015-07-30", which leads to an output of "Jul 30, 2015".
     *
     * If no placeholder is set to the `DatePicker`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
     * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
     *
     * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
     * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
     * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The `DatePicker` is smaller in compact mode and provides a touch-friendly size in cozy mode.
     *
     * On mobile devices, one tap on the input field opens the `DatePicker` in full screen. To close the window,
     * the user can select a date (which triggers the close event), or select Cancel.

     * @SINCE 1.22.0
     *
     * A single-field input control that enables the users to enter a localized date range.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `DateRangeSelection` enables the users to enter a localized date range using touch, mouse, keyboard
     * input, or by selecting a date range in the calendar. They can also navigate directly from one month or
     * year to another.
     *
     * **Note:** The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the `DateRangeSelection` is
     * opened (not used for the initial rendering). If the `sap.ui.unified` library is not loaded before the
     * `DateRangeSelection` is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when
     * the `DateRangeSelection` is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `DateRangeSelection`
     * should also load the `sap.ui.unified` library.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * When to use?
     *
     * If you need a time range and know that your user is a power user who has to input lots of data. If the
     * keyboard is the primary device used for navigating the app, use two input fields. This allows the user
     * to quickly jump from field to field. By selecting a date in one of the fields, the other field should
     * recognize the information and jump to the same selection.
     *
     * When not to use?
     *
     * If the user's primary goal is not to select ranges or if you just want to enter a date and a time. For
     * such cases, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or {@link sap.m.TimePicker}.
     *
     * The user can enter a date by:
     * 	 - Using the calendar that opens in a popup
     * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field (not available for mobile devices)
     *
     * On app level, there are two options to provide a date for the `DateRangeSelection` - date range as a
     * string to the `value` property or JavaScript Date objects to the `dateValue` and `secondDateValue` properties
     * (only one of these options should be used at a time):
     *
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date range is already provided as a formatted string
     * 	 - Use the `dateValue` and `secondDateValue` properties if the date range is already provided as JavaScript
     * 			Date objects or you want to work with JavaScript Date objects
     *
     * Formatting:
     *
     * All formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
     * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.
     *
     * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
     *
     * For example, if the `displayFormat` is "MMM d, y", delimiter is "-", and the used locale is English,
     * a valid value string is "Jul 29, 2015 - Jul 31, 2015" and it is displayed in the same way in the input
     * field.
     *
     * If no placeholder is set to the `DateRangeSelection`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
     * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
     *
     * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
     * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
     * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The `DateRangeSelection` is fully responsive. It is smaller in compact mode and provides a touch-friendly
     * size in cozy mode.

     * @SINCE 1.38.0
     *
     * Enables the users to select date and time values in a combined input.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `DateTimePicker` control consists of two parts: the input field and the date/time picker.
     *
     * **Note:** The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the `DateTimePicker` is opened
     * (not used for the initial rendering). If the `sap.ui.unified` library is not loaded before the `DateTimePicker`
     * is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the `DateTimePicker`
     * is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `DateTimePicker` should also load the `sap.ui.unified`
     * library.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * Use this control if you need a combined date and time input control.
     *
     * Don't use it if you want to use either a date or a time value. In this case, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker}
     * or the {@link sap.m.TimePicker} controls instead.
     *
     * The user can enter a date by:
     * 	 - Using the calendar or a time selector that opens in a popup
     * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
     *
     * On app level, there are two options to provide a date for the `DateTimePicker` - as a string to the `value`
     * property or as a JavaScript Date object to the `dateValue` property (only one of these properties should
     * be used at a time):
     *
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if you want to bind the `DateTimePicker` to a model using the `sap.ui.model.type.DateTime`
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for
     * 			example, as ABAP type DATS field)
     * 	 - Use the `dateValue` property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want
     * 			to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use `dateValue` as a helper property to easily obtain the day,
     * 			month, year, hours, minutes and seconds of the chosen date and time. Although possible to bind it, the
     * 			recommendation is not to do it. When binding is needed, use `value` property instead
     *
     * Formatting:
     *
     * All formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
     * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.
     *
     * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
     *
     * For example, if the `valueFormat` is "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss", the `displayFormat` is "MMM d, y, HH:mm:ss",
     * and the used locale is English, a valid value string is "2015-07-30-10-30-15", which leads to an output
     * of "Jul 30, 2015, 10:30:15".
     *
     * If no placeholder is set to the `DateTimePicker`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
     * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
     *
     * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
     * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
     * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The `DateTimePicker` is responsive and fully adapts to all devices. For larger screens, such as tablet
     * or desktop, it opens as a popover. For mobile devices, it opens in full screen.

     * A popup that interrupts the current processing and prompts the user for an action or an input in a modal
     * mode. Overview: The Dialog control is used to prompt the user for an action or a confirmation. It interrupts
     * the current app processing as it is the only focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked.
     * The content of the Dialog is fully customizable. Structure: A Dialog consists of a title, optional subtitle,
     * content area and a footer for action buttons. The Dialog is usually displayed at the center of the screen.
     * Its size and position can be changed by the user. To enable this, you need to set the properties `resizable`
     * and `draggable` accordingly.
     *
     * There are other specialized types of dialogs:
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.P13nDialog Personalization Dialog} - used for personalizing sorting, filtering and grouping
     * 			in tables
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.SelectDialog Select Dialog} - used to select one or more items from a comprehensive
     * 			list
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.TableSelectDialog Table Select Dialog} - used to make a selection from a comprehensive
     * 			table containing multiple attributes or values
     * 	 - {@link sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog Value Help Dialog} - used to help the user find
     * 			and select single and multiple values
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog View Settings Dialog} - used to sort, filter, or group data within
     * 			a (master) list or a table
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.BusyDialog Busy Dialog} - used to block the screen and inform the user about an ongoing
     * 			operation  Usage: When to use::
     * 	 - You want to display a system message.
     * 	 - You want to interrupt the user’s action.
     * 	 - You want to show a message with a short and a long description.  When not to use::
     * 	 - You just want to confirm a successful action.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 - If the `stretch` property is set to `true`, the Dialog displays on full screen.
     * 	 - If the `contentWidth` and/or `contentHeight` properties are set, the Dialog will try to fill those
     * 			sizes.
     * 	 - If there is no specific sizing, the Dialog will try to adjust its size to its content.  Smartphones:
     * 			If the Dialog has one or two actions, they will cover the entire footer. If there are more actions, they
     * 			will overflow. Tablets: The action buttons in the toolbar are **right-aligned**. Use **cozy** mode on
     * 			tablet devices. Desktop: The action buttons in the toolbar are **right-aligned**. Use **compact** mode
     * 			on desktop.

     * Provides filtering functionality with multiple parameters.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `FacetFilter` control is used to provide filtering functionality with multiple parameters and supports
     * the users in finding the information they need from potentially very large data sets.
     *
     * Your app can have dependencies between facets where selection of filter items in one facet list limits
     * the list of valid filters in another facet list.
     *
     * The `FacetFilter` uses {@link sap.m.FacetFilterList FacetFilterList} and {@link sap.m.FacetFilterItem
     * FacetFilterItem} to model facets and their associated filters.
     *
     * **Note: **{@link sap.m.FacetFilterList FacetFilterList} is a subclass of {@link sap.m.List} and supports
     * growing enablement feature via the property `growing`. When you use this feature, be aware that it only
     * works with one-way data binding. Having growing feature enabled when the `items` aggregation is bound
     * to a model with two-way data binding, may lead to unexpected and/or inconsistent behavior across browsers,
     * such as unexpected closing of the list.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * Use the `FacetFilter` if your app displays a large list of items that can be grouped by multiple parameters,
     * for example products by category and supplier. With the `FacetFilter`, you allow the users to dynamically
     * filter the list so it only displays products from the categories and suppliers they want to see.
     *
     * While the {@link sap.m.FacetFilterList} popup is opened (when the user selects a button corresponding
     * to the list's name), any other activities leading to focus change will close it. For example, when the
     * popup is opened and the app developer loads a {@link sap.m.BusyDialog} or any other dialog that obtains
     * the focus, the popup will be closed.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The `FacetFilter` supports the following two types, which can be configured using the control's `type`
     * property:
     *
     *
     * 	 - Simple type (default) - only available for desktop and tablet screen sizes. The active facets are
     * 			displayed as individually selectable buttons on the toolbar.
     * 	 - Light type - automatically enabled on smart phone sized devices, but also available for desktop and
     * 			tablets. The active facets and selected filter items are displayed in the summary bar. When the user
     * 			selects the summary bar, a navigable dialog list of all facets is displayed. When the user selects a
     * 			facet, the dialog scrolls to show the list of filters that are available for the selected facet.
     *

     *

     * The IconTabBar represents a collection of tabs with associated content. Overview: The IconTabBar can
     * be used for navigation within an object, or as a filter. Different types of IconTabBar are used based
     * on the contents.
     * 	 - Filter - There is only one main content for all tabs. The main content can be filtered, based on
     * 			the selected tab.
     * 	 - Normal tab bar - The contents of each tab are independent from each other.
     * 	 - Combination of the above - There can be both filtered and independent contents.  Structure:
     * 			The IconTabBar can hold two types of entities {@link sap.m.IconTabFilter sap.m.IconTabFilter} and {@link
     * 			sap.m.IconTabSeparator sap.m.IconTabSeparator}
     *
     * The IconTabBarFilter holds all information on an item - text, icon and count.
     *
     * The IconTabBarSeparator holds an icon that can be used to show a process that runs from item to item.
     * Usage: Text only: Uses text labels as tabs with optional counter
     * 	 - Used when there are no suitable icons for all items.
     * 	 - Used when longer labels are needed.
     * 	 - If `headerMode` property is set to `Inline` the text and the count are displayed in one line.
     * 	 - `UpperCase` is disabled.
     * 	 - Use title case.  Icon Tabs: Round tabs with optional counter and label
     * 	 - Used when there are unique icons for all items.
     * 	 - Only shorter labels are possible.
     * 	 - Provide labels for all icons or for none. Do not mix these.  Tabs as filters: Tabs with filtered
     * 			content from the same set of items
     * 	 - Provide an "All" tab to show all items without filtering.
     * 	 - Use counters to show the number of items in each filter.  Tabs as process steps: Tabs show a
     * 			single step in a process
     * 	 - Use an arrow (e.g. triple-chevron) as a separator to connect the steps.
     * 	 - Use counters to show the number of items in each filter.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 - Text-only tabs are never truncated.
     * 	 - Use the `expandable` property to specify whether users can collapse the tab container (default =
     * 			true).
     * 	 - On desktop, tabs can be dragged and dropped (property `enableTabReordering`).
     * 	 - If you have a large number of tabs, you can scroll through them with the arrows. Additionally all
     * 			tabs are available in an overflow button (property `showOverflowSelectList`).

     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * You can enable the autocomplete suggestion feature and the value help option to easily enter a valid
     * value.
     *
     * Guidelines:
     *
     *
     * 	 -  Always provide a meaningful label for any input field
     * 	 -  Limit the length of the input field. This will visually emphasize the constraints for the field.
     *
     * 	 -  Do not use the `placeholder` property as a label.
     * 	 -  Use the `description` property only for small fields with no placeholders (i.e. for currencies).
     *
     *
     * Structure:
     *
     * The controls inherits from {@link sap.m.InputBase} which controls the core properties like:
     * 	 -  editable / read-only
     * 	 -  enabled / disabled
     * 	 -  placeholder
     * 	 -  text direction
     * 	 -  value states  To aid the user during input, you can enable value help (`showValueHelp`) or
     * 			autocomplete (`showSuggestion`). **Value help** will open a new dialog where you can refine your input.
     * 			**Autocomplete** has three types of suggestions:
     * 	 -  Single value - a list of suggestions of type `sap.ui.core.Item` or `sap.ui.core.ListItem`
     * 	 -  Two values - a list of two suggestions (ID and description) of type `sap.ui.core.Item` or `sap.ui.core.ListItem`
     *
     * 	 -  Tabular suggestions of type `sap.m.ColumnListItem`   The suggestions are stored in two aggregations
     * 			`suggestionItems` (for single and double values) and `suggestionRows` (for tabular values).
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * **When to use:** Use the control for short inputs like emails, phones, passwords, fields for assisted
     * value selection.
     *
     * **When not to use:** Don't use the control for long texts, dates, designated search fields, fields for
     * multiple selection.

     *
     * The purpose of the control is to display an image in its original size as long as this is possible. On
     * smaller screens images are scaled down to fit.
     *
     * **Notes:**
     * 	 - If the image doesn't load in 10 seconds, an error is displayed.
     * 	 - Setting the `imageContent` aggregation of the control as well as the source of the image and the
     * 			title of the image is mandatory. If the image source is not set, the control will not open.
     * 			Structure:
     *
     * Each LightBox holds a {@link sap.m.LightBoxItem LightBoxItem} which keeps the properties of the image:
     *
     * 	 -  imageSrc - The source URI of the image
     * 	 -  title - The title of the image
     * 	 -  subtitle - The subtitle of the image
     * 	 -  alt - The alt text of the image   Usage:
     *
     * The most common use case is to click on an image thumbnail to view it in bigger size. When the image
     * that should be displayed in the control cannot be loaded, an error is displayed in the popup.
     *
     * Responsive Behavior:
     *
     * On a mobile device, flipping the device to landscape will flip the lightbox and the image will be adjusted
     * to fit the new dimensions.
     *
     * Additional Information:
     *
     * Check out the API Reference.

     * @SINCE 1.12
     *
     * A hyperlink control used to navigate to other apps and web pages or to trigger actions.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `Link` control is a clickable text element visualized in such a way that it stands out from the standard
     * text. On hover, it changes its style to underlined text to provide additional feedback to the user.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * You can set the `Link` to be enabled or disabled.
     *
     * To create a visual hierarchy in large lists of links, you can set the less important links as `subtle`
     * or the more important ones as `emphasized`.
     *
     * To specify where the linked content is opened, you can use the `target` property.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * If there is not enough space, the text of the `Link` becomes truncated. If the `wrapping` property is
     * set to `true`, the text will be displayed on several lines, instead of being truncated.

     * and systemized way to navigate and explore details for every message. It also exposes an event {@link
     * sap.m.MessagePopover#activeTitlePress}, which can be used for navigation from a message to the source
     * of the issue. Notes::
     * 	 -  Messages can have descriptions pre-formatted with HTML markup. In this case, the `markupDescription`
     * 			has to be set to `true`.
     * 	 -  If the message cannot be fully displayed or includes a long description, the message popover provides
     * 			navigation to the detailed description.  Structure: The message popover stores all messages in an
     * 			aggregation of type {@link sap.m.MessageItem} named `items`.
     *
     * A set of properties determines how the items are rendered:
     * 	 -  counter - An integer that is used to indicate the number of errors for each type
     * 	 -  type - The type of message
     * 	 -  title/subtitle - The title and subtitle of the message
     * 	 -  description - The long text description of the message
     * 	 -  activeTitle - Determines whether the title of the item is interactive  Usage: With the message
     * 			concept, MessagePopover provides a way to centrally manage messages and show them to the user without
     * 			additional work for the developer. The message popover is triggered from a messaging button in the footer
     * 			toolbar. If an error has occurred at any validation point, the total number of messages should be incremented,
     * 			but the user's work shouldn't be interrupted. Navigation between the message item and the source of the
     * 			error can be created, if needed by the application. This can be done by setting the `activeTitle` property
     * 			to true and providing a handler for the `activeTitlePress` event. In addition, you can achieve the same
     * 			functionality inside a different container using the sap.m.MessageView control. Responsive Behavior:
     * 			On mobile phones, the message popover is automatically shown in full screen mode.
     *  On desktop and tablet, the message popover opens in a popover.
     *  On desktop the opened popover is resizable if it is placed in a {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, {@link sap.m.Bar}
     * or used in {@link sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage}

     *
     * **Overview**
     *
     *  A {@link sap.m.MessageView} is used to display a summarized list of different types of messages (errors,
     * warnings, success and information). It provides a handy and systemized way to navigate and explore details
     * for every message. It is meant to be embedded into container controls. If the MessageView contains only
     * one item, which has either description, markupDescription or longTextUrl, its details page will be displayed
     * initially.
     *
     *  **Notes:**
     * 	 - If your application changes its model between two interactions with the MessageView, this could lead
     * 			to outdated messages being shown. To avoid this, you need to call `navigateBack` on the MessageView BEFORE
     * 			opening its container.
     * 	 -  Messages can have descriptions pre-formatted with HTML markup. In this case, the `markupDescription`
     * 			has to be set to `true`.
     * 	 -  If the message cannot be fully displayed or includes a long description, the MessageView provides
     * 			navigation to the detailed description.   **Structure**
     *
     *  The MessageView stores all messages in an association of type {@link sap.m.MessageItem} named `items`.
     *
     *  A set of properties determines how the items are rendered:
     * 	 -  counter - An integer that is used to indicate the number of errors for each type
     * 	 -  type - The type of message
     * 	 -  title/subtitle - The title and subtitle of the message
     * 	 -  description - The long text description of the message
     * 	 -  activeTitle - Determines whether the title of the item is interactive  **Usage**
     *
     *  As part of the messaging concept, MessageView provides a way to centrally manage messages and show them
     * to the user without additional work for the developer.
     *
     * It also exposes an event {@link sap.m.MessageView#activeTitlePress}, which can be used for navigation
     * from a message to the source of the issue.

     * The MultiComboBox control provides a list box with items and a text field allowing the user to either
     * type a value directly into the control or choose from the list of existing items.
     *
     * A drop-down list for selecting and filtering values. Overview: The MultiComboBox control is commonly
     * used to enable users to select one or more options from a predefined list. The control provides an editable
     * input field to filter the list, and a dropdown arrow of available options. The select options in the
     * list have checkboxes that permit multi-selection. Entered values are displayed as {@link sap.m.Token
     * tokens}. Structure: The MultiComboBox consists of the following elements:
     * 	 -  Input field - displays the selected option/s as token/s. Users can type to filter the list.
     * 			Drop-down arrow - expands\collapses the option list.
     * 	 -  Option list - the list of available options.  Usage: When to use::
     * 	 - The user needs to select one or more options from a long list of options (maximum of approximately
     * 			200).  When not to use::
     * 	 - The user needs to choose between two options such as ON or OFF and YES or NO. In this case, consider
     * 			using a {@link sap.m.Switch switch} control instead
     * 	 - You need to display more that one attribute. In this case, consider using the {@link sap.m.SelectDialog
     * 			select dialog} or value help dialog instead.
     * 	 - The user needs to search on multiple attributes. In this case, consider using the {@link sap.m.SelectDialog
     * 			select dialog} or value help dialog instead.
     * 	 - Your use case requires all available options to be displayed right away, without any user interaction.
     * 			In this case, consider using the {@link sap.m.Checkbox checkboxes} instead.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 			If there are many tokens, the control shows only the last selected tokens that fit and for the others
     * 			a label N-more is provided. In case the length of the last selected token is exceeding the width of the
     * 			control, only a label N-Items is shown. In both cases, pressing on the label will show the tokens in
     * 			a popup. On Phones:
     * 	 - A new full-screen dialog opens where all items from the option list are shown.
     * 	 - You can select and deselect items from the option list.
     * 	 - With the help of a toggle button you can switch between showing all tokens and only selected ones.
     *
     * 	 - You can filter the option list by entering a value in the input.  On Tablets:
     * 	 - The auto-complete suggestions appear below or above the input field.
     * 	 - You can review the tokens by swiping them to left or right.  On Desktop:
     * 	 - The auto-complete suggestions appear below or above the input field.
     * 	 - You can review the tokens by pressing the right or left arrows on the keyboard.
     * 	 - You can select single tokens or a range of tokens and you can copy/cut/delete them.

     * correct entry. You can define validator functions to define what token values are accepted. **Notes:**
     *
     * 	 -  New valid tokens are created, when the user presses Enter, selects a value from the suggestions
     * 			drop-down, or when the focus leaves the field.
     * 	 -  When multiple values are copied and pasted in the field, separate tokens are created for each of
     * 			them.
     * 	 -  When a single value is copied and pasted in the field, it is shown as a text value, as further editing
     * 			might be required before it is converted into a token.
     * 	 -  Provide meaningful labels for all input fields. Do not use the placeholder as a replacement for
     * 			the label.  Usage: When to use::
     * 	 -  You need to provide the value help option to help users select or search multiple business objects.
     *
     * 	 -  The dataset to choose from is expected to increase over time (for example, to more than 200 values).
     * 			 When not to use::
     * 	 -  When you need to select only one value.
     * 	 -  When you want the user to select from a predefined set of options. Use {@link sap.m.MultiComboBox}
     * 			instead.  Responsive Behavior: If there are many tokens, the control shows only the last selected
     * 			tokens that fit and for the others a label N-more is provided. In case the length of the last
     * 			selected token is exceeding the width of the control, only a label N-Items is shown. In both cases,
     * 			pressing on the label will show the tokens in a popup. On Phones:
     * 	 -  Only the last entered token is displayed.
     * 	 -  A new full-screen dialog opens where the auto-complete suggestions can be selected.
     * 	 -  You can review the tokens by tapping on the token or the input field.   On Tablets:
     *
     * 	 -  The auto-complete suggestions appear below or above the multi-input field.
     * 	 -  You can review the tokens by swiping them to the left or right.  On Desktop:
     * 	 -  The auto-complete suggestions appear below or above the multi-input field.
     * 	 -  You can review the tokens by pressing the right or left arrows on the keyboard.
     * 	 -  You can select single tokens or a range of tokens and you can copy/cut/delete them.

       * to ensure this.
       *
       * "to" and "back" are the transition functions for the forward and backward navigation. Both will be called
       * with the following parameters: - oFromPage: the Control which is currently being displayed by the NavContainer
       * - oToPage: the Control which should be displayed by the NavContainer after the transition - fCallback:
       * a function which MUST be called when the transition has completed - oTransitionParameters: a data object

       * object could give additional information to the transition function, like the DOM element which triggered
       * the transition or the desired transition duration
       *
       * The contract for "to" and "back" is that they may do an animation of their choice, but it should not
       * take "too long". At the beginning of the transition the target page "oToPage" does have the CSS class
       * "sapMNavItemHidden" which initially hides the target page (visibility:hidden). The transition can do
       * any preparation (e.g. move that page out of the screen or make it transparent) and then should remove
       * this CSS class. After the animation the target page "oToPage" should cover the entire screen and the
       * source page "oFromPage" should not be visible anymore. This page should then have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden".
       * For adding/removing this or other CSS classes, the transition can use the addStyleClass/removeStyleClass
       * method: oFromPage.addStyleClass("sapMNavItemHidden"); When the transition is complete, it MUST call the
       * given fCallback method to inform the NavContainer that navigation has finished!
       *
       * Hint: if the target page of your transition stays black on iPhone, try wrapping the animation start into
       * a setTimeout(..., 0) block (delayed, but without waiting).
       *
       * This method can be called on any NavContainer instance or statically on the sap.m.NavContainer type.
       * However, the transition will always be registered for the type (and ALL instances), not for the single
       * instance on which this method was invoked.
       *
       * Returns the sap.m.NavContainer type if called statically, or "this" (to allow method chaining) if called
       * on a particular NavContainer instance.

     * @SINCE 1.28
     *
     * A container control based on {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, that provides overflow when its content does not
     * fit in the visible area.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The content of the `OverflowToolbar` moves into the overflow area from right to left when the available
     * space is not enough in the visible area of the container. It can be accessed by the user through the
     * overflow button that opens it in a popover.
     *
     * **Note:** It is recommended that you use `OverflowToolbar` over {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, unless you want
     * to avoid overflow in favor of shrinking.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * Different behavior and priorities can be set for each control inside the `OverflowToolbar`, such as certain
     * controls to appear only in the overflow area or to never move there. For more information, see {@link
     * sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData} and {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbarPriority}.
     *
     * Overflow Behavior: By default, only the following controls can move to the overflow area:
     *
     *
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.Button}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.CheckBox}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.ComboBox}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.DatePicker}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.DateTimeInput}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.DateTimePicker}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.Input}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.Label}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.MenuButton}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbarButton}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbarToggleButton}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.SearchField}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.SegmentedButton}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.Select}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.TimePicker}
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.ToggleButton}
     * 	 - {@link sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField}
     * 	 - {@link sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartLabel}
     *
     * Additionally, any control that implements the {@link sap.m.IOverflowToolbarContent} interface may define
     * its behavior (most importantly overflow behavior) when placed inside `OverflowToolbar`.
     *
     * **Note:** The `OverflowToolbar` is an adaptive container that checks the available width and hides the
     * part of its content that doesn't fit. It is intended that simple controls, such as {@link sap.m.Button}
     * and {@link sap.m.Label} are used as content. Embedding other adaptive container controls, such as {@link
     * sap.m.Breadcrumbs}, results in competition for the available space - both controls calculate the available
     * space based on the other one's size and both change their width at the same time, leading to incorrectly
     * distributed space.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The height of the toolbar changes on desktop, tablet, and smartphones.

     * @SINCE 1.16
     *
     * A container control which has a header and content. Overview: The panel is a container for grouping and
     * displaying information. It can be collapsed to save space on the screen. Guidelines::
     * 	 - Nesting two or more panels is not recommended.
     * 	 - Do not stack too many panels on one page.  Structure: A panel consists of a title bar with a
     * 			header text or header toolbar, an info toolbar (optional), and a content area. Using the `headerToolbar`
     * 			aggregation, you can add a toolbar with any toolbar content (i.e. custom buttons, spacers, titles) inside
     * 			the title bar.
     *
     * There are two types of panels: fixed and expandable. Expendable panels are enabled by the `expandable`
     * property. Furthermore you can define an expand animation with the property `expandAnimation`. Usage:
     * When to use::
     * 	 - You need to group or display information and want to give users the option of hiding this information.
     *
     * 	 - You want to show additional information on demand (for example, a panel could show optional input
     * 			fields for an advanced search).
     * 	 - You want to create a panel with controls that do not require user interaction and are not part of
     * 			a form. Depending on the usage, change the `accessibleRole` property from the default `{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole
     * 			Form}` to `{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Region}` or `{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Complementary}`.
     * 			 Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 - If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are resized responsively,
     * 			depending on its parent container.
     * 	 - If the panel has a fixed defined height, it will take up the space, even if the panel is collapsed.
     *
     * 	 - When the panel is expandable, an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header.
     *
     * 	 - When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or close the content
     * 			area.
     * 	 - When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise.
     *
     * 	 - When the height uses the default property `auto`, the height of the content area is automatically
     * 			adjusted to match the height of its content.
     * 	 - When the height of the panel is set to a fixed size, the content area can be scrolled through.

     * @SINCE 1.34
     *
     * Displays rows with appointments for different entities (such as persons or teams) for the selected time
     * interval.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * You can use the `PlanningCalendar` to represent a calendar containing multiple rows with appointments,
     * where each row represents a different person.
     *
     * You can configure different time-interval views that the user can switch between, such as hours or days,
     * and even a whole week/month. The available navigation allows the user to select a specific interval using
     * a picker, or move to the previous/next interval using arrows.
     *
     * **Note:** The `PlanningCalendar` uses parts of the `sap.ui.unified` library. This library will be loaded
     * after the `PlanningCalendar`, if it wasn't loaded first. This could lead to a waiting time when a `PlanningCalendar`
     * is used for the first time. To prevent this, apps that use the `PlanningCalendar` should also load the
     * `sap.ui.unified` library.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * The `PlanningCalendar` has the following structure from top to bottom:
     *
     *
     * 	 - A toolbar where you can add your own buttons or other controls using the `toolbarContent` aggregation.
     *
     * 	 - A header containing a drop-down menu for selecting the {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarView PlanningCalendarViews},
     * 			and navigation for moving through the intervals using arrows or selecting a specific interval with a
     * 			picker. Custom views can be configured using the `views` aggregation. If not configured, the following
     * 			set of default built-in views is available - Hours, Days, 1 Week, 1 Month, and Months. Setting a custom
     * 			view(s) replaces the built-in ones.
     * 	 - The rows of the `PlanningCalendar` that contain the assigned appointments. They can be configured
     * 			with the `rows` aggregation, which is of type {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow PlanningCalendarRow}.
     *
     *
     * Since 1.48 the empty space in the cell that is below an appointment can be removed by adding the `sapUiCalendarAppFitVertically`
     * CSS class to the `PlanningCalendar`. Please note that it should be used only for a `PlanningCalendar`
     * with one appointment per day for a row that doesn't have interval headers set.
     *
     * Since 1.44 alternating row colors can be suppressed by adding the `sapMPlanCalSuppressAlternatingRowColors`
     * CSS class to the `PlanningCalendar`.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * You can define the number of displayed intervals based on the size of the `PlanningCalendar` using the
     * {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarView PlanningCalendarView}'s properties.

     * can also include actions in the footer. Structure: The popover has three main areas:

     * 	 - Content - holds all the controls
     * 	 - Footer (optional) - with additional action buttons  Guidelines:
     * 	 - Do not overlap popovers.
     * 	 - You can determine the {@link sap.m.PlacementType placement} of the popover relative to the control
     * 			that opens it.
     * 	 - Ensure that the content has a basic design and shows only the most important information.  Usage:
     * 			When to use::
     * 	 - You need to define your own structure of controls within the popover.  When not to use::
     *
     * 	 - The {@link sap.m.QuickView QuickView} is more appropriate for your use case.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 			The popover is closed when the user clicks or taps outside the popover or selects an action within the
     * 			popover. You can prevent this with the `modal` property. The popover can be resized when the `resizable`
     * 			property is enabled.
     *
     *
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.Popover} is not responsive on mobile devices - it will always be rendered as
     * 			a popover and you have to take care of its size and position.
     * 	 - {@link sap.m.ResponsivePopover} is adaptive and responsive. It renders as a dialog with a close button
     * 			in the header on phones, and as a popover on tablets.

     * 	 - Radio buttons can have a value state like Error or Warning.
     * 	 - Radio buttons can be arranged vertically by setting the `column` to a number higher than 1.
     * 	 - Radio button options need to have a {@link sap.m.Label label}.  Usage: When to use::
     * 	 - You quickly need to choose between at least two alternatives.
     * 	 - You need to place other controls between the radio button options.  When not to use::
     * 	 - You want to select multiple values for the same option. Use {@link sap.m.CheckBox checkboxes} instead.
     *
     * 	 - When the default value is recommended for most users in most situations. Use a {@link sap.m.Select
     * 			drop-down} instead as is saves space by not showing all the alternatives.
     * 	 - You want have more than 8 options. Use a {@link sap.m.Select drop-down} instead.
     * 	 - When the options are mutually exclusive e.g. ON/OFF. Use a {@link sap.m.Switch switch} instead.
     * 	 - Avoid using horizontally aligned radio buttons as they will be cut off on phones.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the RadioButtons will be selected one after another is determined upon instantiation
     * of the control. This order is consistent with the ARIA attributes for position, which the same button
     * will receive when added to specific group.
     *
     * **Example:** If three buttons are created (`button1, button2, button3`) in consecutive order, initially
     * they will have the same positions and TAB order. However if after that `button1` and `button3` are moved
     * to a new group and then `button2` is added to the same group, their TAB order and position in this group
     * will be `button1, button3, button2`.

     * ways:
     * 	 - Manual search - The search is triggered after the user presses the search button. Manual search uses
     * 			a “starts with” approach.
     * 	 - Live search (search-as-you-type) - The search is triggered after each button press. A suggestion
     * 			list is shown below the search field. Live search uses a “contains” approach.  Usage: When to use::
     *
     * 	 -  Use live search whenever possible.
     * 	 -  Use a manual search only if the amount of data is too large and if your app would otherwise run
     * 			into performance issues.   Responsive Behavior: On mobile devices, there is no refresh button in
     * 			the search field. "Pull Down to Refresh" is used instead. The "Pull Down to Refresh" arrow icon is animated
     * 			and spins to signal that the user should release it.

     * Overview: A SelectDialog is a dialog containing a list, search functionality to filter it and a confirmation/cancel
     * button. The list used in the dialog is a growing list and can be filled with any kind of list item. Structure:
     * Dialog structure: The select dialog has the following components:
     * 	 - Header - title of the dialog
     * 	 - Search field - input field to enter search terms
     * 	 - Info toolbar (only in multi-select) - displays the number of currently selected items
     * 	 - Content - {@link sap.m.StandardListItem standard list items}, {@link sap.m.DisplayListItem display
     * 			list items} or {@link sap.m.FeedListItem feed list items}
     * 	 - Button toolbar - for confirmation/cancellation buttons   List structure & selection:
     * 	 -  The search field triggers the events `search` and `liveChange` where a filter function can be applied
     * 			to the list binding.
     * 	 -  The growing functionality of the list does not support two-way Binding, so if you use this control
     * 			with a JSON model make sure the binding mode is set to `OneWay` and that you update the selection model
     * 			manually with the items passed in the `confirm` event.
     * 	 -  In the multi-select mode of the select dialog, checkboxes are provided for choosing multiple entries.
     *
     * 	 -  You can set `rememberSelections` to true to store the current selection and load this state when
     * 			the dialog is opened again.
     * 	 -  When cancelling the selection, the event `change` will be fired and the selection is restored to
     * 			the state when the dialog was opened.   Usage: When to use::
     * 	 - You need to select one or more entries from a comprehensive list that contains multiple attributes
     * 			or values.   When not to use::
     * 	 -  You need to pick one item from a predefined set of options. Use {@link sap.m.Select select} or {@link
     * 			sap.m.ComboBox combobox} instead.
     * 	 -  You need to select a range of item. Use {@link sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog value
     * 			help dialog instead.
     * 	 -  You need to be able to add your own values to an existing list. Use a {@link sap.m.Dialog dialog}
     * 			instead.   Note:: The property `growing` determines the progressive loading. If it's set to true
     * 			(the default value), the `selected count` in info bar and search will work only for the currently loaded
     * 			items. To make sure that all items in the list are loaded at once and the above feature works properly,
     * 			we recommend setting the `growing` property to false. Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 -  On phones, the select dialog takes up the whole screen.
     * 	 -  On desktop and tablet devices, the select dialog appears as a popover.

     * **Overview**
     *
     * A {@link sap.m.Slider} control represents a numerical range and a handle. The purpose of the control
     * is to enable visual selection of a value in a continuous numerical range by moving an adjustable handle.
     *
     * **Notes:**
     * 	 - Only horizontal sliders are possible.
     * 	 - The handle can be moved in steps of predefined size. This is done with the `step` property.
     * 	 - Setting the property `showAdvancedTooltips` shows an input field above the handle
     * 	 - Setting the property `inputsAsTooltips` enables the user to enter a specific value in the handle's
     * 			tooltip.   **Structure**
     *
     * The most important properties of the Slider are:
     * 	 -  min - The minimum value of the slider range
     * 	 -  max - The maximum value of the slider range
     * 	 -  value - The current value of the slider
     * 	 -  progress - Determines if a progress bar will be shown on the slider range
     * 	 -  step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move  These properties determine
     * 			the visualization of the tooltips:
     * 	 -  showAdvancedTooltips - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle
     * 	 -  inputsAsTooltips - Determines if the tooltip displayed above the slider's handle should include
     * 			an input field  **Usage**
     *
     * The most common usecase is to select values on a continuous numerical scale (e.g. temperature, volume,
     * etc. ).
     *
     * **Responsive Behavior**
     *
     * The `sap.m.Slider` control adjusts to the size of its parent container by recalculating and resizing
     * the width of the control. You can move the slider handle in several different ways:
     * 	 -  Drag and drop to the desired value
     * 	 -  Click/tap on the range bar to move the handle to that location
     * 	 -  Enter the desired value in the input field (if available)
     * 	 -  Keyboard (Arrow keys, "+" and "-")

     * 	 - You need to offer complex filters for the list of items.

     * @SINCE 1.40
     *
     * Allows the user to change the input values with predefined increments (steps).
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `StepInput` consists of an input field and buttons with icons to increase/decrease the value.
     *
     * The user can change the value of the control by pressing the increase/decrease buttons, by typing a number
     * directly, by using the keyboard up/down and page up/down, or by using the mouse scroll wheel. Decimal
     * values are supported.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * The default step is 1 but the app developer can set a different one.
     *
     * On desktop, the control supports a larger step, when using the keyboard page up/down keys. You can set
     * a multiple of the step with the use of the `largerStep` property. The default value is 2 (two times the
     * set step). For example, when using the keyboard page up/down keys the value increases/decreases with
     * a double of the default step. If the set step is 2, the larger step is also 2 and the current value is
     * 1, using the page up key will increase the value to 5 (1 + 2*2).
     *
     * App developers can set a maximum and minimum value for the `StepInput`. The increase/decrease button
     * and the up/down keyboard navigation become disabled when the value reaches the max/min or a new value
     * is entered from the input which is greater/less than the max/min.
     *
     * When to use
     * 	 - To adjust amounts, quantities, or other values quickly.
     * 	 - To adjust values for a specific step.
     *
     * When not to use
     * 	 - To enter a static number (for example, postal code, phone number, or ID). In this case, use the regular
     * 			{@link sap.m.Input} instead.
     * 	 - To display a value that rarely needs to be adjusted and does not pertain to a particular step. In
     * 			this case, use the regular {@link sap.m.Input} instead.
     * 	 - To enter dates and times. In this case, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker}, {@link sap.m.DateRangeSelection},
     * 			{@link sap.m.TimePicker}, or {@link sap.m.DateTimePicker} instead.

     * A container control for managing multiple tabs, allowing the user to open and edit different items simultaneously.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The control contains a `TabStrip` area where the user can choose which tab to view/edit. When the open
     * tabs are more than what can be displayed on the screen, there is an overflow mechanism. To access the
     * tabs hidden in the overflow area, the user has to either use the overflow button (left or right arrow)
     * to scroll them horizontally or the overflow overview button (down arrow) and view all open items as a
     * list.
     *
     * Each tab has a title and a Close Tab button. The title is truncated, if it's longer than 25 characters.
     * On desktop, the Close Tab button is displayed on the currently active tab and for the other tabs
     * it appears on mouse hover. On mobile devices, the Close Tab buttons are always visible.
     *
     * To show that the open items have unsaved changes, the corresponding tabs can display an asterisk (*)
     * after the title as a visual indication that the item is not saved. This is managed by the app developer
     * using {@link sap.m.TabContainerItem TabContainerItem}'s `modified` property.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * The `TabContainer` can have an Add New Tab button, which appears as a '+' icon on the top-right
     * area of the control. When the user clicks or taps this button, the `addNewButtonPress` event is fired.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The `TabContainer` is a full-page container that takes 100% of its parent width and height. As the control
     * is expected to occupy the whole parent, it should be the only child of its parent.

     * A dialog to select items in a table containing multiple values and attributes. Overview: The table select
     * dialog helps users select items in a table-like structure with several attributes and values per item.
     * A search fields helps narrow down the results. Structure: The table select dialog consists of the following
     * elements:
     * 	 -  Search field - used to search enter search terms for a specific item.
     * 	 -  Info toolbar (only in multi-select mode) - displays the number of currently selected items.
     * 	 -  Content - the table with the items.
     * 	 -  Footer (optional) - a toolbar for actions.  Table select dialog supports multi-selection when
     * 			the `multiSelect` property is set.
     *
     * The selected items can be stored for later editing when the `rememberSelections` property is set. **Note:**
     * This property has to be set before the dialog is opened. Usage: When to use::
     * 	 - You need to select one or more items from a comprehensive list that contains multiple attributes
     * 			or values.  When not to use::
     * 	 - You need to select only one item from a predefined list of single-value options. Use the {@link sap.m.Select
     * 			Select} control instead.
     * 	 - You need to display complex content without having the user navigate away from the current page or
     * 			you want to prompt the user for an action. Use the {@link sap.m.Dialog Dialog} control instead.
     * 	 - You need to select items within a query-based range. Use the {@link https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/value-help-dialog/
     * 			Value Help Dialog} control instead.
     * 	 - You need to filter a set of items without any selection. Use the {@link https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/filter-bar/
     * 			Filter Bar} control instead.  Notes::
     * 	 - The property `growing` must not be used together with two-way binding. When the property `growing`
     * 			is set to `true` (default value), the features `selected count` in info bar, `search` and `select/deselect
     * 			all`, if present, work only for the currently loaded items. To make sure that all items in the table
     * 			are loaded at once and the above features work properly, set the property to `false`. Since version
     * 			1.58, the columns headers and the info toolbar are sticky (remain fixed on top when scrolling). This
     * 			feature is not supported in all browsers. For more information on browser support limitations, you can
     * 			refer to the {@link sap.m.ListBase sap.m.ListBase} `sticky` property.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 	On smaller screens, the columns of the table wrap and build a list that shows all the information.

     * 	 - `width` - Width of the control  Parameters that determine the behavior:
     * 	 - `growing` - The text area adjusts its size based on the content
     * 	 - `growingMaxLines` - Threshold for the `growing` property (shouldn't exceed the screen size)
     * 	 - `maxLength` - Maximum number of characters that can be entered in a text area
     * 	 - `wrapping` - The way the entered text is wrapped by the control
     * 	 - `showExceededText` - Determines how text beyond the `maxLength` length is handled  Usage: When
     * 			to use:
     * 	 - You want to enter multiple lines of text.
     * 	 - Always provide labels for a text area.
     * 	 - A placeholder does not substitute a label.  Responsive Behavior:
     * 	 - On smaller screens, you can scroll down the text area to see the entire text. To indicate that the
     * 			text continues, the control shows only half of the last line.
     * 	 - If you have a growing text area, have in mind that its maximum height should not exceed the height
     * 			of the screen. If that is the case, the screen height is used instead.
     * 	 - If `showExceededText` is set to TRUE and you paste a longer text, all characters beyond the `maxLength`
     * 			limit are automatically selected. If `showExceededText` is set to TRUE, the control will display
     * 			a counter for the remaining characters.

     * @SINCE 1.32
     *
     * A single-field input control that enables the users to fill time related input fields.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `TimePicker` control enables the users to fill time related input fields using touch, mouse, or keyboard
     * input.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * Use this control if you want the user to select a time. If you want the user to select a duration (1
     * hour), use the {@link sap.m.Select} control instead.
     *
     * The user can enter a date by:
     *
     *
     * 	 - Using the `TimePicker` dropdown that opens in a popup
     * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
     *
     * On app level, there are two options to provide value for the `TimePicker` - as a string to the `value`
     * property or as a JavaScript Date object to the `dateValue` property (only one of these properties should
     * be used at a time):
     *
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if you want to bind the `TimePicker` to a model using the `sap.ui.model.type.Time`
     *
     * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for
     * 			example, as ABAP type DATS field)
     * 	 - Use the `dateValue` property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want
     * 			to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use `dateValue` as a helper property to easily obtain the hours,
     * 			minutes and seconds of the chosen time. Although possible to bind it, the recommendation is to not to
     * 			do it. When binding is needed, use `value` property instead
     *
     * Formatting:
     *
     * All formatting and parsing of values from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
     * If a value is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format and locale.
     *
     * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
     *
     * A time format must be specified, otherwise the default "HH:mm:ss a" will be used. For example, if the
     * `valueFormat` is "HH-mm-ss a", the `displayFormat` is "HH:mm:ss a", and the used locale is English, a
     * valid value string is "10-30-15 AM", which leads to an output of "10:30:15 AM".
     *
     * If no placeholder is set to the `TimePicker`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
     * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
     *
     * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
     * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
     * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The `TimePicker` is responsive and fully adapts to all device types. For larger screens, such as tablet
     * or desktop, it opens as a popover. For mobile devices, it opens in full screen.

     * @SINCE 1.16
     *
     * Horizontal container most commonly used to display buttons, labels, selects and various other input controls.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * By default, the `Toolbar` items are shrinkable if they have percent-based width (for example, {@link
     * sap.m.Input} and {@link sap.m.Slider}) or implement the {@link sap.ui.core.IShrinkable} interface (for
     * example, {@link sap.m.Text} and {@link sap.m.Label}). This behavior can be overridden by providing {@link
     * sap.m.ToolbarLayoutData} for the `Toolbar` items.
     *
     * **Note:** It is recommended that you use {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbar} over `sap.m.Toolbar`, unless you
     * want to avoid the overflow behavior in favor of shrinking.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * You can add a visual separator between the preceding and succeeding {@link sap.m.Toolbar} item with the
     * use of the {@link sap.m.ToolbarSeparator}. The separator is theme dependent and can be a padding, a margin
     * or a line.
     *
     * To add horizontal space between the `Toolbar` items, use the {@link sap.m.ToolbarSpacer}. You can define
     * the width of the horizontal space or make it flexible to cover the remaining space between the `Toolbar`
     * items (for example, to to push an item to the edge of the `Toolbar`.
     *
     * **Note:** {@link sap.m.ToolbarLayoutData} should not be used together with {@link sap.m.ToolbarSpacer}.

     * Helps the user to sort, filter, or group data within a (master) {@link sap.m.List} or a {@link sap.m.Table}.
     * The dialog is triggered by icon buttons in the table toolbar. Each button shows a dropdown list icon.
     *
     * Overview:
     *
     * The `ViewSettingsDialog` is a composite control, consisting of a modal {@link sap.m.Popover} and several
     * internal lists. There are three different tabs (Sort, Group, Filter) in the dialog that can be activated
     * by filling the respective associations. If only one association is filled, the other tabs are automatically
     * hidden. The selected options can be used to create sorters and filters for the table.
     *
     * **Note:** If the app does not offer all three sorting, filtering, and grouping operations, but only one
     * of these (such as sort), we recommend placing the icon button directly in the toolbar. Do not place sort,
     * filter, or group buttons in the footer toolbar if they refer to a table. Place group, sort, and filter
     * buttons in the footer toolbar if they refer to a master list.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     * When to use?
     * 	 - If you need to allow the user to sort line items in a manageable list or table (up to 20 columns)
     *
     * 	 - If you need to offer custom filter settings in a manageable list or table (up to 20 columns)
     * 	 - If you need to allow the user to group line items in a manageable list or table (up to 20 columns)
     *
     * When not to use?
     * 	 - If you have complex tables (more than 20 columns)
     * 	 - If you need to rearrange columns within your table (use the {@link sap.m.TablePersoDialog} instead)
     *
     * 	 - If you need very specific sort, filter, or column sorting options within complex tables (use the
     * 			{@link sap.m.P13nDialog} instead)
     *
     * Responsive behavior:
     *
     * The popover dialog appears as a modal window on desktop and tablet screen sizes, but full screen on smartphones.
