# UI5-TypeScript

UI5-TypeScript is an npm [mono-repo][mono-repo] that contains tooling to support [TypeScript][typescript] in SAP UI5 Projects.
These tooling can enable:

- Better IDE integration for SAP UI5 projects (e.g content assist).
- Using TypeScript compiler to perform type checks on SAP UI5 applications.
- More easily implementing UI5 applications in TypeScript thus enjoying the general benefits of TypeScript.

It currently contains a single public package:

- [@ui5/dts-generator](./packages/dts-generator) A low level compiler which transforms SAP UI5 api.json format to TypeScript definition(dts) file format.

## How to obtain the UI5 TypeScript signatures?

The UI5 type signatures generated by the [@ui5/dts-generator](./packages/dts-generator)
are created and published as part of the UI5 build process.

With npm:

- `npm install @sapui5/ts-types --save-dev`

With Yarn

- `yarn add @sapui5/ts-types --dev`

See the [demos](./demos) directory for consumption examples of said signatures.
