** IMPORTANT **
This tracker is for issues caused by the tools maintained here (type definition generator and ts-interface generator for control development support).
But if the bug is within the original OpenUI5/SAPUI5 code/JSDoc, then please report the issue there!

Example: if a UI5 API is defined wrongly in the TypeScript type definitions but the same wrong definition can also be found in the [UI5 API documentation](https://ui5.sap.com), then the issue originates probably from the JSDoc inside the UI5 code, from which both are generated, and needs to be reported in the [OpenUI5 issue tracker](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/issues/new) or the one for SAPUI5, respectively. 

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
